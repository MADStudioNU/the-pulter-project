    <h2 class="t">Rereading Pulter’s Confinement in the Pandemic</h2>
    <div class="by-line"><span class="who">Excerpts authored by Chloe Carmen, Sam Grady, Jordan Haas, Michael Hamilton, Tymber Hetsler, Diana Lugo-Garza, Tasneem Mohammed, Jessica Mullet, Hester Pulter, Xamina Stalnaker, Owen Weingartner, and several people who preferred to remain anonymous; instigated by Elizabeth Zeman Kolkovich; introduced and edited by by Leah Knight</span></div>

    <p>How might our reading (and teaching) of Pulter’s verse change during a period characterized by historically specific and widely shared, if still inequitable, experiences of isolation? This Exploration addresses that question by interspersing lines from one of Pulter’s poems, <a href="/poems/57" title="Read “Why Must I Thus Forever Be Confined” (Poem 57)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Why Must I Thus Forever Be Confined</span><span class="idx">57</span></a>, with the reflections of students  in Elizabeth Zeman Kolkovich’s “British Literature, Medieval to 1800” online course at Ohio State University. (Responses have been lightly edited and are published with the approval of the authors.)</p>
    <p>These students read Pulter’s poem in the spring of 2021, in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which had by that point been unfolding for a full year. In this context, Kolkovich asked her students to comment on how the poem spoke to them. She notes, “I think I found their responses so moving because I know most of them only as names and black Zoom boxes, or maybe a still photo—and these posts helped me see the people they are, with all their challenges and hopes.”</p>
    <p>This Exploration is offered as a source of possible inspiration for other instructors seeking to integrate Pulter’s verse into their courses in the wake of the global pandemic, which has recalibrated almost everyone’s sensitivity to the experience and ramifications of different degrees and kinds of isolation. </p>
    <p>Pandemic or not, the resonant theme of isolation can be integrated into a unit on Pulter’s verse with relative ease. She already has a growing reputation as a poet of isolation—not only because her manuscript met with no known readers for centuries, but also because of various poems where the speaker ruminates on confinement and the deprivation of liberty. In <a href="/poems/54" title="Read “A Solitary Complaint” (Poem 54)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">A Solitary Complaint</span><span class="idx">54</span></a>, for instance, she asks, "Must I be still confined to this sad grove / Whenas those vast and glorious globes above / Eternally in treble motions move?" (lines 1-3.)</p>
    <p>The very next poem (<a href="/poems/55" title="Read “Must I Thus Ever Interdicted Be” (Poem 55)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Must I Thus Ever Interdicted Be</span><span class="idx">55</span></a>) opens with a variation on this inquiry: “Must I thus ever interdicted be, / My gracious God?” (lines 1-2). The implication is that she is forbidden from entering church; she goes on to note that “The wanton sparrow and the chaster dove / Within Thy sacred temple freely move” (lines 10-11)—birds have freedom, but not her.</p>
    <p>Being stuck in a grove or forbidden from church: these conditions are challenging enough, but in <a href="/poems/51" title="Read “Made When I Was Not Well” (Poem 51)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Made When I Was Not Well</span><span class="idx">51</span></a>, Pulter refers to her very <span class="it">body</span> as a “loathsome ruined prison” (line 2) for her soul. Elsewhere, addressing a period of illness when she longs to die, she laments to (and of) her soul: “thou cans’t not go, / Thy Great Creator, He says, ‘no’” (<a href="/poems/66" title="Read “Made When My Spirits Were Sunk Very Low With Sickness and Sorrow” (Poem 66)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Made When My Spirits Were Sunk Very Low With Sickness and Sorrow</span><span class="idx">66</span></a>, lines 7-8). To experience one’s own embodied self as a site of captivity is bad indeed—although, from her spiritual perspective, it was also and paradoxically a salutary realization or remembrance, since it kept her attention and devotion appropriately focused beyond the body.</p>
    <p>In <a href="/poems/30" title="Read “The Center” (Poem 30)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">The Center</span><span class="idx">30</span></a>, however, Pulter lets herself imagine not spiritual salvation but simply her own thoughts as a countervailing force against such bodily confinement; at least, she briefly interrogates the possibility that her thoughts can fly where no body might (line 24); she lets them levitate a while before humbly summoning their inevitable descent: “my thoughts, to native earth descend” (line 37). Confinement within a body on earth is the natural habitat not just of Pulter’s person (or all persons, really), but of Pulter’s poetic persona—nonetheless, her resistance to that confinement comes just as naturally, or perhaps artfully.</p>
    <p>Pulter’s experiences of confinement were, in many ways, particular to her historical circumstances: one poem, for instance, presents itself as having been composed during a culturally-defined period of “lying in” assigned to women who had just given birth in early modern England (<a href="/poems/45" title="Read “This Was Written in 1648, When I Lay in, With my Son John” (Poem 45)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">This Was Written in 1648, When I Lay in, With my Son John</span><span class="idx">45</span></a>). Today, many if not most people’s circumstances and experiences of confinement and isolation have been radically reinscribed since the spring of 2020 and the global spread of COVID-19. How might readers of the future look back on our own accounts of this experience? We can only imagine.</p>

      <li class="l"><span class="bt">Why Must I Thus Forever Be Confined?</span></li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">The title sounds like a Smiths B-side. —Sam Grady</span></li>
      <li class="l">Why must I thus forever be confined</li>
      <li class="l">Against the noble freedom of my mind[?]  (1-2)</li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">This pandemic definitely has me feeling like I do not have the freedom that I used to have. —Chloe Carmen</span></li>
      <li class="l">Whenas each hoary moth, and gaudy fly</li>
      <li class="l">Within their spheres enjoy their liberty?</li>
      <li class="l">The virgin bee her luscious cell forsakes</li>
      <li class="l">And on a thousand flowers pleasure takes;</li>
      <li class="l">The glist’ring beetle casts her stag-like horns,</li>
      <li class="l">The next year new her stately front adorns:</li>
      <li class="l">She rolls her unctuous embryo east and west</li>
      <li class="l">To call great Nature, who hears her behest[.] (3-10)</li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">Others have liberty while the narrator does not. This seems similar to how in the pandemic, it is encouraged that people try to stay home because it can help end the pandemic sooner, but a lot of people seem to ignore it. —Michael Hamilton</span></li>
      <li class="l">The silkworm feeds, then works, then she involve</li>
      <li class="l">Herself, then breeds, then flies till she dissolves. (11-12)</li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">I found the imagery she used when describing the natural world intriguing. Pulter seems to be looking out onto nature with reverence and an appreciation for the beauty of it while she’s confined in some way. But this could also sound like someone bored to death of the endless cycle of living and life and how futile it seems. This sounds like a very bleak interpretation of the cycle of life and perhaps how all life is just nothing more than feeding, working, breeding, and then dying. —Sam Grady</span></li>
      <li class="l">The basilisk, that kills by fascination,</li>
      <li class="l">Is not like me tied to one habitation;</li>
      <li class="l">No, nor the catablepe whose pois’nous eye,</li>
      <li class="l">Where’er she goes, makes grass and flowers die: (13-16)</li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">For me, “she” is the Coronavirus that infects and kills people, and “makes grass and flowers die” (16), “yet may … freely range” (17). —Jessica Mullet</span></li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">The two creatures the author refers to are deadly: they seek and cause destruction. This made me reflect on my time during COVID-19 because I felt morally obligated to stay at home while some of my other friends did not feel that same weight, and wanted me to hang out with them. I wished that I did not care, because I began to get stir-crazy. I wanted to neglect my responsibilities and go out anyways, but I knew that would not be the best idea. —Tymber Hetsler</span></li>
      <li class="l">Though these destroy, yet may they freely range</li>
      <li class="l">Whilst I am shut up in a country grange. (17-18)</li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">My family and I had COVID-19 back in April of last year and we were stuck in my house for two straight weeks. This was a rough time for me as I was sick and not allowed to leave my house, and when Pulter says, “Whilst I am shut up in a country grange,” it reminds me a lot of being stuck in my house during that hard time. —Anonymous</span></li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">These lines reminded me of being locked inside my house for three months and not being able to do or see anyone due to Covid 19. —Anonymous</span></li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">I think the speaker might be referring to being trapped by her own moral obligations, wishing she could be careless and free no matter the cost. —Tymber Hetsler</span></li>
      <li class="l">My looks, though sad, would make my friend revive;</li>
      <li class="l">Why must I then be buried thus alive? (19-20)</li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">When I was in isolation for those two weeks, I missed my friends very much. I feel like if I would have seen one of my close friends during the time I had coronavirus, I would have no longer felt sick anymore as I think it would have “revived” me, similar to what Pulter said. —Anonymous</span></li>
      <li class="l">The amphisbaena, that at both ends kill,</li>
      <li class="l">Doth freely slide about wheree’er she will;</li>
      <li class="l">The dipsas that doth make men die with quaffing,</li>
      <li class="l">And the tarantula, that kills with laughing,</li>
      <li class="l">With that bold worm which killed the  Egyptian queen</li>
      <li class="l">All freely crawling ’bout the world are seen.</li>
      <li class="l">Thus insects, reptiles that spontaneous breed,</li>
      <li class="l">From such a solitude as mine are freed[.] (21-8)</li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">During Covid, with days bleeding together and this year-long monotony, a lot of the things we’re supposed to have a newfound appreciation for—like nature—seems colder and sadder than pre-Covid. We’re taking a step back and looking at things from the same kind of confinement as Pulter, though she seems to marvel at the wonder of it all, while my immediate reading of it, in Covid 2k21, seems to gravitate to a bleaker place.—Sam Grady</span></li>
      <li class="l">And I (O my sad heart) and only I</li>
      <li class="l">Must in this sad confinement living die. (29-30)</li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">In our family, we had relatives pass away from Covid, without having a loved one there one last time. These lines fit with Covid in the fact that many people who get Covid are alone in the Covid wards when they pass away. —Diana Lugo-Garza</span></li>
      <li class="l">The swiftest dolphin and the vastest whale</li>
      <li class="l">Are not immured as I, in wall or pale,</li>
      <li class="l">But every sort of fish, even as they please,</li>
      <li class="l">Do dive and swim about the spacious seas[.] (31-4)</li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">In COVID times I’ve found myself being jealous of the freedom of animals and how they, without the worries of our world,, enjoy a deeper freedom than we could ever enjoy even with wealth. —Xamina Stalnaker</span></li>
      <li class="l">The flying fish, though she doth oft despair,</li>
      <li class="l">Yet she commands the seas and vaster air;</li>
      <li class="l">And those fair birds which hover still above,</li>
      <li class="l">Which are so far indulgent to their love</li>
      <li class="l">To let their females lay upon their back:</li>
      <li class="l">No noble freedom surely they can lack,</li>
      <li class="l">Nor do they fear the terriblest tyrant’s lower</li>
      <li class="l">Should shut them in a bastille or a tower,</li>
      <li class="l">For they disdain to touch this dunghill earth;</li>
      <li class="l">Thus they enjoy the freedom of their birth,</li>
      <li class="l">But I to solitude am still confined:</li>
      <li class="l">The cruelest curb unto a noble mind. (35-50)</li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">Pulter writes of envying the freedom of animals in nature during her confinement. In the Covid pandemic, I see that same envy of freedom internationally as some countries are stuck in quarantine while others are beginning to open back up.  ...  It’s so easy to look at these other countries and their progress and feel frustrated with your own country’s stagnation. This feeling relates to Pulter’s perception of animals having a sort of unattainable freedom. I feel like Pulter, trapped inside or confined, where other opening nations are the free animals in nature. —Jordan Haas</span></li>
      <li class="l">The halcyon that calms the ruffling seas</li>
      <li class="l">Is not restrained, but flies where’er she please;</li>
      <li class="l">Nor doth the swan, on Thames her silver breast,</li>
      <li class="l">Ask leave to rise off from her downy nest;</li>
      <li class="l">The rav’nous ravens, deaf to their young ones’ cry,</li>
      <li class="l">May in the spacious air most freely fly;</li>
      <li class="l">But I above my life my children love,</li>
      <li class="l">Yet I, to comfort them, cannot remove. (51-8)</li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">I could relate to the way Pulter described the activities that all the bees, fish, birds, and other animals were doing as she watched in confinement. This is similar to how I watched on my phone or thought about the activities I was doing before COVID-19 now in confinement living through the pandemic. The feeling of isolation that Pulter felt as she compared the freely moving animals to her isolated self is similar to me comparing my more free self before the pandemic to my isolated self now. —Tasneem Mohammed</span></li>
      <li class="l">The foolish ostrich doth her eggs expose</li>
      <li class="l">To thousand dangers ere they do disclose,</li>
      <li class="l">Yet proudly she by wind and wing is born;</li>
      <li class="l">The swiftest horse and rider she doth scorn.</li>
      <li class="l">But I, for mine, would willingly dissolve,</li>
      <li class="l">Yet sad obscurity doth me involve.</li>
      <li class="l">The mild and tenderhearted turtledove</li>
      <li class="l">That was so constant to her only love,</li>
      <li class="l">Though she resolves to have no second make,</li>
      <li class="l">Yet she her flight about the air doth take;</li>
      <li class="l">But I, that am more constant than this dove,</li>
      <li class="l">Unto my first and last and only love</li>
      <li class="l">Cannot from this sad place (ay me) remove. (59-71)</li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">She continuously mentions breeding and frequently mentions displays of love between animals. She loves her children. I believe she felt trapped in love, at home. I think she wants to travel and experience the world, but feels stuck at home without much say. —Xamina Stalnaker</span></li>
      <li class="l">All volatiles, from the eagle to the dove,</li>
      <li class="l">Their freedom freely both enjoy and love,</li>
      <li class="l">But I no liberty expect to have</li>
      <li class="l">Until I find my freedom in my grave. (76-9)</li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">Pulter explains that she will have no liberty or freedom until she dies, and I relate to her sense of hopelessness and not knowing what is in store for my future. —Owen Weingartner</span></li>
      <li class="l">The swiftest su no liberty can lack</li>
      <li class="l">That bears her sprightly offspring on her back;</li>
      <li class="l">The cannibal, when she the huntsman hears,</li>
      <li class="l">Her pretty younglings in a wallet bears;</li>
      <li class="l">Thus from pursuers they are all secure,</li>
      <li class="l">But these sad shades doth me (ay me) immure,</li>
      <li class="l">That I cannot assist mine in their sorrow,</li>
      <li class="l">Which makes me sigh and weep both eve and morrow. (80-7)</li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">While the author compares herself to animals in the wild to show how little freedom she has, I use memories from the past to show how much things have changed. There are a lot of people across the US and in Canada from my church who I have not seen for a very long time because of certain laws in our countries and there is nothing I can do about it but wait. —Owen Weingartner</span></li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">‘these sad shades doth me (ay me) immure’ is very relatable to the pandemic: being stuck against one’s will within the shades of any kind of confinement; being stuck within the confines of home for months at a time … —Anonymous</span></li>
      <li class="l">The lion, tiger, elephant, and bear,</li>
      <li class="l">And thousands more, do no confinement fear.</li>
      <li class="l">Thus beasts, birds, fishes, equivocal worm and fly</li>
      <li class="l">Enjoy more liberty (woe’s me!) than I. (88-91)</li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">Her comparisons to wild animals being free made me think about how some animals are locked up in zoos being moved from one place to another instead of only being locked down to one place. And that’s kind of how I have been going from place to place since COVID started with my military training, not being able to leave the bases once I get there just being moved around wherever I am told to go.—Anonymous</span></li>
      <li class="l">Wer’t for my God, King, country, or my friend,</li>
      <li class="l">My love, my children, ’twere a noble end;</li>
      <li class="l">Or wer’t for sin, my guilty head I would hide</li>
      <li class="l">And patiently the stroke of death abide;</li>
      <li class="l">Or wer’t my venial slips to expiate,</li>
      <li class="l">Then my restraint would have a happy date;</li>
      <li class="l">Or wer’t for debt, I soon could pay that score:</li>
      <li class="l">But ’tis, O my sad soul—I’ll say no more. (92-9)</li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">During Covid, I dealt with a really hard loss of a family member, my father, and because of Covid it was extremely difficult and stressful. Due to all the restrictions and in the end I couldn't even go and see my father before his cremation. These lines to me talk about the fact that if it wasn't for their family or friends their suffering would be so much worse. —Anonymous</span></li>
      <li class="l">For I no liberty expect to see</li>
      <li class="l">Until to atoms I disperséd be;</li>
      <li class="l">Then, being enfranchised, free as my verse,</li>
      <li class="l">I shall surround this spacious universe,</li>
      <li class="l">Until, by other atoms thrust and hurled,</li>
      <li class="l">We give a being to another world. (101-106)</li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">Even without COVID, aren’t I restrained? By job, by poverty, by expectations, by debt? Will I ever be free if I have to be of the world?</span></li>
        <li class="l t-4"><span class="it">I was absolutely blown away by this poem. —Xamina Stalnaker</span></li>
