    <p>
      Pulter often used the word “revolution,” but how far were her political views revolutionary? There are several
      layers to disentangle. From contemporaries down to today’s historians, the causes and meaning of the mid-century
      political upheavals have been subject to much debate. Some have read them as the first of a series of epochal
      modern revolutions ushering in modern economic and political orders. A socio-economic analysis was already being
      broached by contemporaries like Lucy Hutchinson. Soon after its first printing in 1806, her <span class="it">Memoirs of the Life of Colonel Hutchinson</span>
      was translated into French at the behest of François Guizot’s history of what he termed <span class="it">La Révolution d’Angleterre</span>, the first part composed before his own major period of political power under Louis Philippe from 1832, the second
      after his displacement during the revolutions of 1848. Guizot hailed the English and French Revolutions as the two
      greatest events in history, despite his many reservations about both — and about Lucy Hutchinson.<a
      class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-1" id="fna-1-1">1</a> Karl Marx formed his own ideas of a bourgeois revolution in hostile dialogue with Guizot, and a host of works by Christopher Hill over many years tested Marxist
      models against a growing awareness of the importance of religious factors. From the 1970s Hill became a prime
      target for “revisionist” historians. These were responding in part to a large increase in the availability of
      local manuscript sources which presented empirical challenges to some larger social and economic models. While
      differing on many points, the revisionists generally took a sharply deflationary view of the
      mid-seventeenth-century conflicts, now seen as a short-term breakdown in a consensual political order, fuelled by
      the difficulty of ruling three kingdoms and by separate religious fanaticism. This is not so unlike the view of
      some royalists at the time. These debates have been replayed in contemporary poetry.<a
      class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-2" id="fna-1-2">2</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      In the last few years there has been a qualified return to taking a larger view of the English Revolution in a
      global perspective, now with a heightened awareness of the costs of “progress,” from the emergent slave trade to
      environmental impact. New work influenced by disability history highlights the scale of the war’s violence and
      loss of life, sometimes brushed over in more glamorized accounts, and shows its particular impact on a number of
      named women in Pulter’s Hertfordshire.<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-3" id="fna-1-3">3</a>
      Questions of gender are receiving fuller attention — documents by women did not square with the revisionist
      emphasis on “high” politics.<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-4" id="fna-1-4">4</a> Research
      continues to bring out the period’s innovation, notably the first regular newsbooks presenting opposing political
      positions, and a press unprecedentedly broad in social and intellectual range. A recent installation at Nottingham
      Castle Museum presents the manuscript of <span class="it">Memoirs of the Life of Colonel Hutchinson</span> as part
      of a narrative of rebellion in the City through the Luddites to Black Lives Matter and the LGBT+ movement.

      Pulter’s poetry may not fit so easily into such a narrative but certainly reflects rebellious times. At a semantic
      level, “revisionist” critiques of the term “English Revolution” point out that in the seventeenth century
      “revolution” normally referred to cyclical changes rather than permanent shifts. Strikingly, Pulter’s manuscript
      places these issues together: three impassioned political poems are followed by <a href="/poems/16" title="Read “The Revolution” (Poem 16)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span
      class="t">The Revolution</span><span class="idx">16</span></a>, <a href="/poems/17"

                                                                         class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span

                                                                             title="Read “The Desire” (Poem 18)"
                                                                             class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span
      class="t">The Desire</span><span class="idx">18</span></a>. Liza Blake writes: “dissolution, resolution,
      revolution, and involution These repetitions of words and concepts appear across the different poems in her work,
      from the political poetry … to the religious, cosmological, and philosophical poetry.”<a
      class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-5" id="fna-1-5">5</a> Blake and other critics have shown that Pulter
      uses this and related terms in complex senses, sometimes referring to the radically new Copernican cosmology, and
      often moving from recurrence to final permanent change. As for the political upheavals of her time, Pulter never
      calls them a “revolution” but her successive poems give a powerful sense of shocked responses to events which in
      turn seem to her “unparallelled,” (<a href="/poems/14"
                                            title="Read “On the Horrid Murder of that Incomparable Prince” (Poem 14)"
                                            class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">On the Horrid Murder of that Incomparable Prince</span><span
      class="idx">14</span></a>, line 2), and which indeed involved an unprecedented degree of popular involvement in
      public affairs. Her poems nonetheless seek parallels in history and mythology, both to find a secure framework in
      chaotic times and to deepen their poetic resonance.
    </p>

    <p>
      In political terms, her poems are counter-revolutionary: Pulter fiercely attacked what seemed to her a chaotic Babel of new voices, culminating in the political revolution of 1649. And yet the confidence with which as a woman poet she offered her judgements on public affairs was something new. A generation earlier, male poets had often preceded political comments with an apology for venturing on mysteries of state normally confined to a small circle, and for a woman poet to enter on this terrain was still bolder. Katherine Philips prefaced an attack on a defender of the regicide with the declaration that “I think not on the state” — though she continued with a scorching critique of the republic, which was placed at the head of the 1664 and 1667 editions of her poems (see Exploration: <a class="pp-exploration-ref" href="/#women-writers-and-the-english-revolution" target="_blank">Women Writers and the English Revolution</a>). For her part, Pulter made no apologies, and like her Fidelia, she had no doubt about her equal intellectual standing with men. Unlike many contemporary women, she does not justify her speech by her association with her husband, about whom she is most conspicuously silent in the manuscript. (There is a striking difference from Margaret Cavendish and Lucy Hutchinson, whose husbands both encouraged their writing and were acknowledged in it.) While many royalists grounded obedience to the king in the Fifth Commandment, in children’s obedience to their father (the “patriarchal” political theory), the father of Pulter’s children, living and dead, is passed over. Her public poems are striking in their self-confidence and also in their literary self-consciousness, experimenting in forms and genres. While like other contemporary poets she aims to chronicle events somewhat in the manner of the new weekly newsbooks, she also engages with the more universal poetic ambitions of John Milton.

      Using the classical image of the populace as the Hydra, the many-headed monster, Pulter presents the events as
      part of a traditional cycle, the revolution of Fortune’s wheel; at the end Essex’s fate is compared to that of his
      father, who had followed a traditional pattern of aristocratic rebellion against a sovereign to whom they owed
      allegiance. And indeed, as John Adamson has shown, Essex and other aristocratic Parliamentarians did look to
      medieval precedents.<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-6" id="fna-1-6">6</a> But Pulter noted some

      This vivid phrase catches the combination of new military technology with the mechanisms of print: from the 1620s
      Parliament had begun presenting a series of proposals to the King which, though cast as humble petitions,
      increasingly challenged his ultimate authority, until it claimed the right to raise forces against the King’s. And
      in the 1640s what Pulter terms “pop’lar breath” (line 11) began to present petitions, whose appearance in print
      moved their impact beyond traditional elite circles, escalating demands for wider constitutional reform.
      Hertfordshire presented more petitions to Parliament than any other county, quickly backing them up with volunteer
      fighters.<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-7" id="fna-1-7">7</a> The first such petition was in fact
      presented by Arthur, Lord Capel, later to be celebrated by Pulter as a royalist martyr, but he quickly went over
      to the king when he saw the emergent power of the popular breath, and he campaigned out of the county. Even though
      there were many royalists amongst the gentry, the county’s proximity to London meant that Parliament retained
      control, and the Parliamentary committees in St Albans and Hertford were dominated by urban radicals and by
      members of the lesser gentry. This was indeed a revolutionary dispersal of those traditionally considered the
      county’s natural rulers. Arthur Pulter maintained neutrality, taking no role in any county committee while
      avoiding any sanctions as a suspected royalist; there is evidence that he had some Puritan sympathies (Ross,
      “‘This Kingdoms Loss,’” 140). Parliament’s dominance meant that there was no fighting in Hertfordshire, but the
      county saw more troop movements than anywhere else as soldiers passed through it to the north and east. Quartering
      of soldiers caused much grievance. Some troops were stationed at Pulter’s own Broadfield in 1644, in which year
      her son-in-law, John Forrester, signed a bill for the militia committee, so some of her family sustained
      Parliamentary connections.<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-8" id="fna-1-8">8</a>

      It is Forrester’s wife, Margaret, along with her sister Penelope, whom Pulter invites to “come, make haste away”
      to the country (<a href="/poems/2" title="Read “The Invitation into the Country” (Poem 2)" class="pp-poem-ref"
                         target="_blank"><span class="t">The Invitation into the Country</span><span
      class="idx">2</span></a>). This poem gains remarkable force as the stock theme of the superiority of rural to
      urban life is gradually undermined. With the king in captivity to the army, and Broadfield itself not free from
      the military — “Enameled vales and crystal streams / Prove now, alas, sad Broadfield’s dreams” — the poem turns
      the invitation into a bid for comfort in shared grief, the landscape being tainted:

      Vivid assonance and alliteration make the first couplet beat with a military pulse, and the brief pastoral reprise
      with nymphs in the shadows is broken with the sinister image of stalking soldiers. These are the effects that
      Marvell aimed at in “The Nymph Complaining for the Death of her Fawn” and in “Upon Appleton House” amongst other
      poems. Karen Britland has pointed out that Thomas Stanley’s circle of royalist poets, with whom Marvell would have
      some association, was based a few miles from Broadfield Hall.<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-9"
                                                                      id="fna-1-9">9</a> Whether, or however, Pulter and
      Marvell knew each other’s work, they both conveyed intense emotions about contemporary disruptions through
      mythopoeic distancing (another example being <a href="/poems/46" title="Read “The Lark” (Poem 46)"
                                                      class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span
      class="t">The Lark</span><span class="idx">46</span></a>). In <a href="/poems/4"
                                                                       title="Read “The Complaint of Thames, 1647, When the Best of Kings was Imprisoned by the Worst of Rebels at Holmby” (Poem 4)"
                                                                       class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span
      class="t">The Complaint of Thames, 1647, When the Best of Kings was Imprisoned by the Worst of Rebels at Holmby</span><span
      class="idx">4</span></a>, the river is agonized at having been polluted by the London radicals, denouncing its
      “licentious [“Unrestrained by law, decorum, or morality,” <span class="it">Oxford English Dictionary 2</span>]
      dames.” Pulter may again be thinking of petitioning: while this activity in itself alarmed conservatives, the
      emergence of petitions specifically by women in the 1640s caused especial panic amongst many Parliamentarians as
      well as royalists — though, as Ann Hughes points out, mainly when their claims were opposed on other grounds.<a
      class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-10" id="fna-1-10">10</a> In the poem’s remarkable climax, the Thames
      wishes that the whole city should “unpitied burn,” and ends with a fantasy of avoiding the city by going
      underground, bearing the rebels with her to eternal punishment. This unusual conclusion may have been suggested by
      Milton, who in the 1645 <span class="it">Poems</span> twice alluded to the nymph Arethusa, transformed into a
      river to escape the river-god Alpheus and passing under the ocean to Greece. In <span class="it">Lycidas</span>
      the myth signifies the beauty of pastoral poetry which runs under the sterner voices of Phoebus and St. Peter
      (Ovid, <span class="it">Metamorphoses</span>, 5.574–641; <span class="it">Arcades</span>, lines 30–31; <span
      class="it">Lycidas</span>, lines 85, 132. <span class="it">Arcades</span> was printed in 1645 immediately after
      the sonnet to Pulter’s sister, Lady Margaret Ley). The lyrical river poetry of classical and English topographical
      and pastoral verse here turns hellish.

      Pulter’s title refers to the king’s being held in captivity on the orders of Parliament, an event she also
      commemorated in <a href="/poems/ae/13"
                         title="Read “Upon the Imprisonment of his Sacred Majesty, That Unparalleled Prince, King Charles the First” (Poem 13)"

      class="idx">13</span></a>. This poem is placed in the manuscript before a blank page, then followed by two poems
      on the death of Charles I, followed by a blank page and then by <a href="/poems/16"
                                                                         title="Read “The Revolution” (Poem 16)"
                                                                         class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span
      class="t">The Revolution</span><span class="idx">16</span></a>, so that political and universal changes are placed
      in some kind of balance. We do not know whether such blanks had any particular significance, but these two poems
      are linked formally by using rhyming triplets, and they deploy her characteristic vocabulary: Poem 13 rhymes
      “dissolved” and “involved” before the conclusion’s determined “To pray and weep for him I am resolved.” Ruth
      Connolly shows how tightly controlled and generically self-conscious this poem was, in contrast with more troubled
      and openly topical contemporary poems, and suggests that Pulter may have written such poems but not preserved
      them. Certainly, “far from being cut off from events Pulter had access to a constant supply of news and London
      newsprint and was constructing herself as an active combatant in the Royalist struggle to control the narrative of
      Charles’s defeat” (Ruth Connolly, Headnote to <a href="/poems/ae/13" title="Read “Upon the Imprisonment of his Sacred Majesty, That Unparalleled Prince, King Charles the First” (Poem 13)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Upon the Imprisonment of his Sacred Majesty, That Unparalleled Prince, King Charles the First</span><span
      class="idx">13</span></a>). This poem was probably written in early 1647, soon after the king’s imprisonment.
      Shocking as Pulter found that event, what followed was still more unparalleled: in June 1647 a group of soldiers
      seized the king, fearing that the faction then dominant in Parliament would make a deal that would ultimately
      restore him to full power. The radicals of the New Model Army, often in collaboration with Leveller reformers,
      were now political players, sometimes resisting their own commanders.</p>
    <p>When royalists rose again in the spring and summer of 1648, they were decisively defeated, one of their last
      stands being at Colchester, where Sir Thomas Fairfax took the city and on 28 August ordered the execution of Sir
      Charles Lucas and Sir George Lisle. Pulter’s neighbor and relation Arthur Lord Capel escaped this fate as an
      aristocrat and was imprisoned pending trial by his peers. Pulter’s poetry shares the shock of so many royalists at
      the treatment of their officers, and opens, like many topical poems of the time, as if she has just heard a piece
      of news: “Is Lisle and Lucas slain? Oh say not so” (<a href="/poems/7" title="Read “On those Two Unparalleled Friends, Sir George Lisle and Sir Charles Lucas, Who Were Shot to Death at Colchester” (Poem 7)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">On those Two Unparalleled Friends, Sir George Lisle and Sir Charles Lucas, Who Were Shot to Death at Colchester</span><span class="idx">7</span></a>). Once again she attacks the dominance of the “Hydra:”

      The Independents are linked with religious, irreligious or ethnic Others to discredit them. Words of one, then
      two, then four syllables enact a swelling tide of disorder that breaks chaotically through the line-break at
      “all.” Once again, however, Pulter distances herself from many contemporary polemics, seeking to universalize
      Lisle and Lucas through myth and history.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Frances E. Dolan points out (Curation: <a class="pp-curation-ref" href="/poems/ee/on-those-two-unparalleled-friends-sir-george-lisle-and-sir-charles-lucas-who-were-shot-to-death-at-colchester/#commemorating-the-dead" target="_blank">Commemorating the Dead</a>), Pulter may well engage
      here with <span class="it">Lycidas</span>, a poem meditating on a shockingly unexpected death and finding
      consolation in fame. Pulter’s repeated “Had they been there” of characters who might have saved him parallels
      Milton’s “Had ye been there.” One of them is Mars, who was “tried on the Areopagus”; Pulter is likely to have
      known, and strongly disliked, Milton’s <span class="it">Areopagitica</span> with its passionate defense of the new
      democratic print culture. Pulter introduces as characters the Parcae or Fates, who draw out, measure and cut the
      thread of life; for a moment Clotho hesitates, enacting the time when it seemed possible that Lucas and Lisle
      might be reprieved, before Atropos “with her fatal scissors snipped them both.” The vivid alliteration and
      assonance here perhaps refines on Milton’s “Comes the blind Fury with th’ abhorred shears, / And slits the thin
      spun life” (<span class="it">Lycidas</span>, lines 75–6: Milton, unusually, conflates the Fates with the Fury).
      Poetic admiration as well as Milton’s friendship with her sister could have drawn her back to Milton; it is even
      possible, though unlikely, that through her Pulter knew that Milton had recently addressed a sonnet to Fairfax “at
      y<sup>e</sup> seige of Colchester.” Though the title indicates that the sonnet was written before the deaths of
      Lucas and Lisle, and it ends with a call for peace, the poets were poles apart: for Milton, Hydra’s heads are
      those of royalist rebellions. Nonetheless, Pulter was clearly an attentive reader of this poet, partly because for
      all their political differences, he shared her preference for more ambitious, mythopoeic verse over topical
      polemic.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pulter was still absorbing the news about Lucas and Lisle when much more astonishing news reached her. With a
      speed that probably bewildered Fairfax as well as Pulter, the royalists’ defeat led to a new wave of radical
      petitions, a military purge of Parliament, and the trial and execution of the king on 30 January 1649. This last
      event surprised even many Parliamentarians, and came after a dizzying series of moves and counter-moves. As
      Presbyterians in the Commons moved to a new treaty with the king, and looked to be allowing royalist ringleaders
      like Capel to go free, Levellers and radical soldiers outside Parliament organized a petitioning campaign in
      support of a <span class="it">Remonstrance of the Army</span>, which demanded exemplary justice on the king and
      leading figures in the second Civil War. A petition from Pulter’s Hertfordshire, where Levellers were strong,
      urged Fairfax as <span class="it">Pater Patriae</span> to act decisively on the army’s demands.<a
      class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-11" id="fna-1-11">11</a> These petitions have often been read as
      “regicide” rather than “republican,” demanding Charles’s execution as a blood-sacrifice; but as Nora Carlin has
      shown, they called for wide political reforms and did not focus solely on the king. Some recent historians have
      denied that the call for justice necessarily demanded his death; even until the day before his execution, it is
      possible that some attempts were made to spare him provided that he made some kind of recantation. That, however,
      would have meant acknowledging limits to his authority which he would not accept.<a
      class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-12" id="fna-1-12">12</a> While English kings had been deposed and even
      murdered before, for a king to be put on trial by subjects was a radical break with the past, and even revisionist
      historians may allow that this was a political, if not a social or economic, revolution. Other historians are
      exploring the way the revolution opened up English trade and commerce on a global scale.<a
      class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-13" id="fna-1-13">13</a> The destruction of the English church, with
      freedom for different forms of Protestant worship, was another momentous break with the past.
    </p>

    <p>
      Capel’s trial and execution followed quickly in the wake of the king’s. Pulter responded to these events in three
      very different poems. Their dates cannot be certainly known, as the surviving manuscript does not follow
      chronological order, but with the exception of <a href="/poems/ae/13" title="Read “Upon the Imprisonment of his Sacred Majesty, That Unparalleled Prince, King Charles the First” (Poem 13)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Upon the Imprisonment of his Sacred Majesty, That Unparalleled Prince, King Charles the First</span><span class="idx">13</span></a>, the poems on Charles may plausibly have been written in the manuscript order. The Lucas and Lisle poem is immediately followed by <a href="/poems/8" title="Read “On that Unparalleled Prince Charles the First, His Horrid Murder” (Poem 8)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">On that Unparalleled Prince Charles the First, His Horrid Murder</span><span class="idx">8</span></a>, indicating that the original pages with these poems may have been kept together. <a href="/poems/14" title="Read “On the Horrid Murder of that Incomparable Prince” (Poem 14)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">On the Horrid Murder of that Incomparable Prince</span><span class="idx">14</span></a>, and <a href="/poems/15" title="Read “Let None Sigh More for Lucas or for Lisle [On the Same (2)]” (Poem 15)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Let None Sigh More for Lucas or for Lisle [On the Same (2)]</span><span class="idx">15</span></a>, follow together a little later, with a blank page separating Poem 14 from the preceding poem on the king in prison in 1647, and another blank separating Poem 15 from its successor. This may indicate that they had been written together on a folded sheet or “separate.” Poem 8 represents the poet’s shock at the regicide through an extended set of cosmological analogies, and declares that Parliament’s “devils” will.

    </div>

    <p>
      The uncharacteristic “feminine endings” of the final couplet, with trailing eleventh syllables, seem to hint at
      doubts about the return of Charles II, which Pulter casts as an “Unless,” leaving the final emphasis on
      “frustrate.” In fact, by placing so much emphasis on the analogy between the king and the indispensable sun,
      Pulter has made it hard to imagine a royal restoration. Though “On That Unparalleled Prince Charles the First: His
      Horrid Murder” follows the Lucas-Lisle poem in the manuscript, the focus on the king’s centrality leaves no room
      for other royalists. Though she declares that “Our spirits exhale in sighs” (line 16), the poet does not otherwise
      explicitly voice emotion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Poems 14 and 15 seem to represent a new departure. Poem 14 focuses on the expression of emotion, albeit in a carefully controlled form. Poem 15, connected by its opening to the previous poem, looks back to Pulter’s elegy for Lucas and Lisle and tries to relate her mourning for them and more recently for Arthur, Lord Capel, to the emotions aroused by the barely comprehensible regicide, coming at the end to a more confident prophecy of the return of Charles II (see Headnote to <a href="/poems/ae/15" title="Read “Let None Sigh More for Lucas or for Lisle [On the Same (2)]” (Poem 15)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Let None Sigh More for Lucas or for Lisle [On the Same (2)]</span><span class="idx">15</span></a>).
    </p>

    <p>
      In terms of political content, Pulter’s polemical poems accord with the royalists for whom there was nothing positive in the Revolution. Even here there are potential complexities: Capel was championed by the Leveller John Lilburne, for whom the establishment of the republic was a military coup betraying earlier promises of major democratic reforms (see Curation <a href="/poems/ae/let-none-sigh-more-for-lucas-or-for-lisle-on-the-same-2/#arthur-first-baron-capel" class="pp-curation-ref" target="_blank">Arthur, first Baron Capel (1604–49)</a>). The Levellers had their own appeal to women, though to lower social ranks than the poets of the gentry: ten thousand are said to have signed a petition for Lilburne. Nevertheless, much as Pulter would have disapproved of these women, the confidence with which she articulated her poetic voice as a woman was something relatively new (see Exploration <a href="/#women-writers-and-the-english-revolution" target="_blank" class="pp-exploration-ref">Women Writers and the English Revolution</a>). In her political poems, topical concerns never overbalance her recurrent concern for the craft of poetry; in subtle ways these poems tie in with other works in the manuscript of her collected poems. A historiography of the Revolution omitting women like Pulter will be incomplete.
