    <p>
      Pulter often employs the poetic convention of the blazon. She uses it to express her grief over her daughter Jane’s death (<a href="/poems/11" title="Read “Tell Me No More [On the Same]” (Poem 11)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Tell Me No More [On the Same]</span><span class="idx">11</span></a>), to assess the effects of aging and illness on her own body (<a href="/poems/51" title="Read “Made When I Was Not Well” (Poem 51)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Made When I Was Not Well</span><span class="idx">51</span></a>), and to imagine an ideal female beloved (<a href="/poems/59" title="Read “My Love Is Fair” (Poem 59)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">My Love Is Fair</span><span class="idx">59</span></a>). In each case, she draws on well-known conventions and familiar precedents, but employs them inventively and even unpredictably. Her debts and her innovations are most visible when we read her blazons in relation to others. This exploration gathers definitions of the blazon, some pithy and provocative critical claims about its functions and effects, and a range of poems in the genre, including both sixteenth-century models Pulter might have encountered and the ways her contemporaries (especially Margaret Cavendish) joined her in playing with the genre’s possibilities and implications.

    <h3>What is a Blazon? Definitions and Discussion</h3>

    <p><span class="it">Blazon</span>, n.: from the verb: “A description or record of any kind, esp. a record of virtues or excellencies” (<span class="it">Oxford English Dictionary</span> II 4).</p>

    <p><span class="it">Blazon</span>, v.: “To describe fitly, set forth honourably in words; to proclaim, make public, ‘trumpet’” (<span class="it">Oxford English Dictionary</span> 4, 6a).</p>

    <p>In poetry: A poetic style that describes various parts of the beloved’s body, usually by comparing each part to an object.</p>

    <div class="q">
      <p>“[Petrarch’s] Laura is always presented as a part or parts of a woman. When more than one part figures in a single poem, a sequential, inclusive ordering is never stressed. Her textures are those of metals and stones; her image is that of a collection of exquisitely beautiful disassociated objects. Singled out among them are hair, hand, foot, and eyes …. More specifically Petrarchan, however, is the obsessive insistence on the particular, an insistence that would in turn generate multiple texts on individual fragments of the body or on the beauties of woman.” </p>

    <div class="q">
      <p>“By introducing the concept of merchandizing into the economy of description, Shakespeare’s speaker … transforms the direct line one would expect to unite lover and beloved into a triangle. Here a lyric ‘I’ does not privately speak to a lyric ‘you’ but rather, by ‘publishing his love,’ interjects a third term: ‘I’ speaks ‘you’ to an audience that, it is hoped, will in turn purchase ‘you.’ The relationship so constructed involves an active buyer, an active seller, and a passive object for sale.”</p>

    <h3>Further Reflections on the Blazon as Recipe</h3>
    <div class="q">

      <p>
        In her “Fancies,” Cavendish links the blazon to the recipe or receipt, raising the question of how an inventory of attributes resembles a list of ingredients. As Wendy Wall points out, in this satirical poem by William King, “The speaker mocks reversals in the order of serving as well as hybrid, excessive, and artificial dishes. In his argument for artistic decorum, King pointed to meals that failed to respect natural correspondences; seafood, for instance, should be served with herbs associated with their living state. True cookery, in this poem, rests not simply in emulating one’s social betters, affirming political allegiance, or displaying national virtue, but in its regard for a naturalized (even mimetic) aesthetics. When King figures its violation as a grotesque female portrait pieced from diverse animal and human elements, he points backward to satiric renditions of the blazoned woman as a body literally composed from jewels, cosmological elements, flowers, and food.”

          <div class="intro-note">In this blazon of Adam, Hutchinson makes it explicit, as Milton does not, that she imagines Adam, the first human, as not just “fair” but white-skinned. As his name, linked to the Hebrew word for ground (adamah) signals, he “takes his low original” from “the common ground.” But Hutchinson assumes that, nevertheless, he is not brown.</div>

          <li class="l">Whereas all other creatures clothed were</li>
          <li class="l">In shells, scales, gaudy plumes, or wools or hair,</li>
          <li class="l">Only a fair smooth skin o’re man was drawn,</li>

          <li class="l">The azure veins, where blood and spirits flow,</li>
          <li class="l">Like violets in a field of lilies show.</li>
          <li class="l">As others have a down-bent countenance,</li>
          <li class="l">He only doth his head to heaven advance,</li>
          <li class="l">Resembling thus a tree whose noble root</li>
          <li class="l">In heaven grows, whence all his graces shoot.</li>
          <li class="l">He only on two upright columns stands;</li>
          <li class="l">He only hath, and knows the use of, hands,</li>
          <li class="l">Which God's rich bounties for the rest receive,</li>

          <li class="l">He only hath a voice articulate,</li>
          <li class="l">Varied by joy, grief, anger, love and hate,</li>
          <li class="l">And every other motion of the mind,</li>

          <li class="l">Hereby glad mirth in laughter is alone</li>
          <li class="l">By man expressed. In a peculiar groan,</li>
          <li class="l">His grief comes forth, accompanied with tears;</li>
          <li class="l">Peculiar shrieks utter his sudden fears.</li>
          <li class="l">Herein is musick too, which sweetly charms</li>
          <li class="l">The sense, and the most savage heart disarms.</li>
          <li class="l">The gate of this, God in the head did place,</li>
          <li class="l">The head which is the body’s chiefest grace,</li>
          <li class="l">The noble palace of the royal guest,</li>
          <li class="l">Within by fancy and invention dressed,</li>
          <li class="l">With many pleasant useful ornaments</li>
          <li class="l">Which new imagination still presents,</li>
          <li class="l">Adorned without, by majesty and grace.</li>
          <li class="l">O who can tell the wonders of a face!</li>
          <li class="l">In none of all his fabrics more than here</li>
          <li class="l">Doth the Creator’s glorious power appear,</li>
          <li class="l">That of so many thousands which we see</li>
          <li class="l">All human creatures like, all different be.</li>
          <li class="l">If the front be the glory of man’s frame,</li>

          <li class="l">Illustrate it, and as day’s radiant star,</li>
          <li class="l">In the clear heaven of a bright face are.</li>
          <li class="l">Here love takes stand, and here ardent desire</li>
          <li class="l">Enters the soul, as fire drawn in by fire.</li>
          <li class="l">At two ports, on each side, the hearing sense</li>
          <li class="l">Still waits to take in fresh intelligence;</li>
          <li class="l">But the false spies both at the ears and eyes,</li>
          <li class="l">Conspire with strangers for the soul’s surprize,</li>
          <li class="l">And let all life-perturbing passions in,</li>
          <li class="l">Which with tears, sighs and groans issue again.</li>
          <li class="l">Nor do those labyrinths, which like breast-works are,</li>
          <li class="l">About those secret ports, serve for a bar</li>
          <li class="l">To the false sorcerers conducted by</li>
          <li class="l">Man’s own imprudent curiosity.</li>
          <li class="l">There is an arch i’the middle of the face</li>
          <li class="l">Of equal necessary use and grace,</li>
          <li class="l">For there men suck up the life-feeding air,</li>
          <li class="l">And panting bosoms are discharged there;</li>
          <li class="l">Beneath it is the chief and beauteous gate,</li>
          <li class="l">About which various pleasant graces wait,</li>
          <li class="l">When smiles the ruby doors a little way</li>
          <li class="l">Unfold, or laughter doth them quite display,</li>
          <li class="l">And opening the vermillion curtains shows</li>
          <li class="l">The ivory piles set in two even rows,</li>
          <li class="l">Before the portal, as a double guard,</li>
          <li class="l">By which the busy tongue is helped and barred;</li>
          <li class="l">Whose sweet sounds charm, when love doth it inspire,</li>
          <li class="l">And when hate moves it, set the world on fire.</li>
          <li class="l">Within this portal’s inner vault is placed</li>
          <li class="l">The palate, where sense meets its joys in taste.</li>
          <li class="l">On rising cheeks, beauty in white and red</li>
          <li class="l">Strives with itself, white, on the forehead spread,</li>
          <li class="l">Its undisputed glory there maintains,</li>
          <li class="l">And is illustrated with azure veins.</li>
          <li class="l">The brows love’s bow and beauty’s shadow are;</li>
          <li class="l">A thickset grove of soft and shining hair</li>
          <li class="l">Adorns the head, and shows like crowning rays,</li>
          <li class="l">While th’air’s soft breath among the loose curls plays.</li>
          <li class="l">Besides the colors and the features, we</li>
          <li class="l">Admire their just and perfect symmetry,</li>
          <li class="l">Whose ravishing resultance is that air</li>
          <li class="l">That graces all, and is not anywhere;</li>
          <li class="l">Whereof we cannot well say what it is,</li>
          <li class="l">Yet beauty’s chiefest excellence lies in this,</li>
          <li class="l">Which mocks the painters' in their best designs,</li>
          <li class="l">And is not held by their exactest lines.</li>
          <li class="l">But while we gaze upon our own fair frame,</li>
          <li class="l">Let us remember too from whence it came,</li>
          <li class="l">And that by sin corrupted now, it must</li>
          <li class="l">Return to its originary dust.</li>
          <li class="l">How indecently doth pride then lift that head</li>
          <li class="l">On which the meanest feet must shortly tread?</li>
          <li class="l">Yet at the first it was with glory crowned,</li>
          <li class="l">Till Satan’s fraud gave it the mortal wound.</li>
          <li class="l">This excellent creature God did Adam call</li>
          <li class="l">To mind him of his low original,</li>
          <li class="l">Whom he had formed out of the common ground</li>
          <li class="l">Which then with various pleasures did abound.</li>
