    <p>
      No one knows what Hester Pulter looked like; no visual representation of her person seems to have survived. Of her
      appearance, we know no more than such glimpses as she appears to present in poems such as <a href="/poems/51" title="Read “Made When I Was Not Well” (Poem 51)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span
      class="t">Made When I Was Not Well</span><span class="idx">51</span></a>, where she contrasts her now dimmed,
      dull, saddened eyes with their former sprightliness in youth; her thin, lank, silver hair with her erstwhile
      golden-brown curls; and her now-withered with once-swelling breasts. This self-deprecating and seemingly
      forthright blazon goes some way toward letting us picture Pulter in her middle years—though we should remain alert
      to the possibility that it might instead deceive us altogether, even as to the identity of its speaker, which of
      course might not be the poet at all. Just as a poem in the first-person might or might not be autobiographical,
      this poem might or might not provide a reliable picture of Pulter’s body, even as it offers up her chosen
      portrayal of a possible self.
    </p>
    <p>
      When treated with an appropriate mix of imagination and caution, what can complement this fragmentary and
      uncertain verbal version of a self-portrait are some depictions of and by her contemporaries, including visual
      representations of family members and others who shared her social status. Of course, all images, whether verbal
      or visual, are stylizations that offer only proxies for and approximations of the objects represented, rather than
      the objects themselves. This Exploration offers a brief visual tour of some such depictions, in various media,
      including some that might even have been made by Pulter. Still other visions of her might yet turn up in an attic
      or at auction, as Pulter’s manuscript did after centuries of similar invisibility.

    <p>
      The portrait above depicts a family to which Pulter was related by marriage. Her husband, Arthur Pulter, was first
      cousin to Arthur Capel, the adult male depicted here. Capel was born in 1604, a year before Hester Pulter. She
      addresses him as “noble Capel” and “heroic kinsman” in <a href="/poems/15"
                                                                title="Read “Let None Sigh More for Lucas or for Lisle [On the Same (2)]”"

      class="idx">15</span></a>, where she laments his death, which took place by beheading after he, a Royalist officer
      in the civil wars, briefly escaped from prison. The Capels, when painted, were extremely rich thanks to an
      inheritance of extensive estates in 1632. This portrait thus depicts a family related to Pulter, and of similar
      social status, but of considerably greater wealth. The setting for this portrait is the Capel family home at
      Hadham Hall, in Little Hadham, Hertfordshire—or, rather, that home’s Italianate garden, a costly addition
      commissioned by Arthur Capel. Hadham Hall lay about a dozen miles from where Pulter lived her married life at
      Broadfield; while the Capels are depicted visually in relation to the garden, Pulter depicts herself verbally in
      relation to the garden at Broadfield estate (see, for instance, <a href="/poems/12" title="Read “The Garden”"
                                                                         class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span

                                                                        class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span

    </p>

    <p>
      While we may not have a visual portrait of Hester Pulter, either alone or <span class="it">en famille</span>, we
      do have several such representations of her father, most of which designate and celebrate whichever public office
      or offices he occupied at the time. These depictions include the following painting, made after he was elevated
      from the office of Lord High Treasurer in the court of James I to the rank of earl:

    <p>The intricate lace ruff and cap, as well as the miniature portrait of James I and the wand associated with his
      position as the royal treasurer, all convey qualities of dignity and authority which may or may not have been
      warranted by the sitter’s character in public office or private life. (For more details on this and other
      portraits from the period, see Roy Strong, <span class="it">Tudor and Jacobean Portraits</span> [Her Majesty’s
      Stationery Office, 1969], esp. pp. 206–7).</p>

    <p>In contrast, of Pulter’s mother, born Mary Petty, the only known likeness is the effigy on her tomb in the church
      at Westbury, the village in Wiltshire where Pulter likely spent some part of her childhood after her family
      returned from Ireland.</p>

    <p>Pulter’s parents are entombed side by side at Westbury, even though her father remarried twice after the death of
      his first wife.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Just as we possess no likeness of Pulter, none apparently survive of her fifteen children. John Milton, in a
      sonnet about Pulter’s father addressed to Pulter’s sister, Margaret, persuaded himself that “by you, Madam, me
      thinks I see him living yet” (lines 10–11); we are not similarly privileged to conjure up a vision of Pulter by
      consulting the appearance of her offspring.</p>

    <p>We have reason to suspect, however, that Pulter lived with a scaldingly intense mental portrait of her daughter,
      Jane, who died at the age of twenty. Two years after her death, Pulter writes movingly of her “milky limbs” and
      “snowy skin” (lines 11, 34), as well as of one symptom of what killed her—“the spots upon her fair skin … / Like
      drops of blood upon unsullied snow”—in <a href="/poems/10"
                                                title="Read “Upon the Death of my Dear and Lovely Daughter, Jane Pulter” (Poem 10)"
                                                class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Upon the Death of my Dear and Lovely Daughter, Jane Pulter</span><span
        class="idx">10</span></a>, lines 51–2). Jane’s brown curls, black eyes, and snowy skin are similarly, if
      reluctantly, memorialized in <a href="/poems/11" title="Read “Tell Me No More [On the Same]” (Poem 11)"
                                      class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span
        class="t">Tell Me No More [On the Same]</span><span class="idx">11</span></a>. Of course, Pulter’s memory, like
      her writing, might well have been shaped by the poetic tradition of the blazon, among others, in which these poems
      participate—a possibility that need not subtract from the authenticity or artistry of her word-painting as a
      memorial of a vanished beloved body.</p>

    <p>While we are not aware of any visual representations of Pulter’s children, might one or more of her daughters
      likenesses survive, if not in a painting, in a piece of embroidery like this one?</p>

    <p>
      We know nothing of the maker of this piece—nor, indeed, of the maker’s gender, or even (I would argue) the gender of the figures portrayed (which is nonetheless inferred in the museum’s description, quoted in the attribution statement above). However, in this period and place, women were often expected to create such intricate needlework artifacts. Susan Frye has argued that textiles like this were “once ubiquitous media ... to which women were valued contributors and through which women simultaneously asserted and explored their identities.”<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-1" id="fna-1-1">1</a> If Frye is right, then such visual evidence should be considered alongside easel paintings and other media when we try to imagine how women understood and crafted their embodied appearance in the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is also possible that Pulter stitched her own self-portrait. If so, the incomplete visage on the central figure of the embroidered sampler, below, seems an apt emblem of Pulter’s relationship to the act of revealing her person. In this sampler, the sole human figure, missing a facial outline, is distinguished from the fully-finished depictions of the other creatures (so like those which populatePulter’s emblematic verse).

      Out of an understandable kind of curiosity, we often crave a glimpse of authors’ faces; but we might find that we see more, as this sampler emblematically suggests, when we keep a steady eye on the depictions that artists like Pulter create instead.
