    <p>
      To say Pulter’s poetry is concerned with death is an understatement. Death appears <span
      class="it">constantly</span> in the many lyrics and emblems collected in the Leeds manuscript: Pulter writes about
      the death of her many children, of her beloved king, and especially about the specter of her own mortality. <span
      class="it">Pulter Project</span> editors have tagged 53 of the manuscript’s 120 poems—over 44%—with the topic
      “death”; this doesn’t include the many others that explore related topics like grief, decay, sickness, and
      resurrection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking across this body of work, this Exploration traces eight of the major features Pulter seems to identify in
      death. In each case, I sketch out some of the broad themes that emerge across the collection and identify some
      poems in which those ideas are developed. Such categories and lists are by no means exclusive; as the following
      sections make clear, Pulter often approaches death from multiple (and sometimes even contradictory) perspectives
      in the same poem. Nonetheless, the following eight themes offer readers a starting point from which to start
      thinking about the complexity of Pulter’s thinking about mortality. Following each feature, I also offer a brief
      list of other texts from other early modern poets and thinkers that provide additional perspectives on that aspect
      of mortality.
    </p>

    <h3>Death is natural</h3>
    <p>
      Pulter’s poems find death written across the rhythms of the natural world. The cycles of living and dying are often prefigured in the revolutions of night and day (see, for instance, <a href="/poems/3" title="Read “Aurora [1]” (Poem 3)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Aurora [1]</span><span class="idx">3</span></a>, <a href="/poems/5" title="Read “Of Night and Morning” (Poem 5)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Of Night and Morning</span><span class="idx">5</span></a>, <a href="/poems/34" title="Read “To Aurora [3]” (Poem 34)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">To Aurora [3]</span><span class="idx">34</span></a>, <a href="/poems/37" title="Read “Aurora [2]” (Poem 37)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Aurora [2]</span><span class="idx">37</span></a>, or <a href="/poems/47" title="Read “Why Art Thou Sad at the Approach of Night” (Poem 47)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Why Art Thou Sad at the Approach of Night</span><span class="idx">47</span></a>), the movements of the heavens (see, for instance, <a href="/poems/1" title="Read “The Eclipse” (Poem 1)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">The Eclipse</span><span class="idx">1</span></a> or <a href="/poems/30" title="Read “The Center” (Poem 30)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">The Center</span><span class="idx">30</span></a>), or the meteorological rhythms of the weather (see, for instance, <a href="/poems/17" title="Read “The Circle [1]” (Poem 17)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">The Circle [1]</span><span class="idx">17</span></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pulter also finds death in what we might call the ecological, in the creatures and ecosystems of the non-human world. See, for instance, poems such as <a href="/poems/35" title="Read “The Pismire” (Poem 35)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">The Pismire</span><span class="idx">35</span></a> or <a href="/poems/46" title="Read “The Lark” (Poem 46)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">The Lark</span><span class="idx">46</span></a>, or many of Pulter’s emblem poems, such as <a href="/poems/74" title="Read “The Turtle” (Emblem 8)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">The Turtle</span><span class="idx">74</span></a>, <a href="/poems/85" title="Read “This Poor Turtledove” (Emblem 20)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">This Poor Turtledove</span><span class="idx">85</span></a>, <a href="/poems/105" title="Read “View But This Tulip” (Emblem 40)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">View But This Tulip</span><span class="idx">105</span></a>, or <a href="/poems/98" title="Read “This Fell Catablepe” (Emblem 33)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">This Fell Catablepe</span><span class="idx">98</span></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The insight Pulter draws from death’s ubiquity in nature varies poem to poem. Sometimes, death’s presence in the natural world helps bolster a poem’s argument that the reader has nothing to fear in dying. Death is everywhere, Pulter writes; it inheres in all things, helping to shape the fundamental rhythms of existence. This familiarity—the natural-ness of death—means that mortality isn’t something to be feared, but something instead to be regarded as just part of life itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But other times, death’s presence in nature becomes part of the argument <span class="it">for</span> death. The fact that this world is a dying world, a world in which death is everywhere, means that the only way of escaping death is, paradoxically, by dying. Only through the transformation of death can Pulter imagine entering into eternal life, into a world where death is no more.

    <h3>Death is physical</h3>
    <p>
      Perhaps as a consequence of its presence in nature, death is, in Pulter’s depictions, also closely linked with
      materiality. Dying seems to be visible, first and foremost, in the physical erosion of matter. In Pulter’s work,
      this is most immediately visible in the health (or illness) of the human body. Pulter was keenly aware of the
      (sometimes slow, and sometimes frighteningly quick) breakdown of the body’s systems. See, for instance, poems
      reflecting on her family’s or her own illness, such as
      <a href="/poems/6" title="Read “Universal Dissolution” (Poem 6)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span
        class="t">Universal Dissolution</span><span class="idx">6</span></a>,
      <a href="/poems/10" title="Read “Upon the Death of my Dear and Lovely Daughter, Jane Pulter” (Poem 10)"
         class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span
        class="t">Upon the Death of my Dear and Lovely Daughter, Jane Pulter</span><span class="idx">10</span></a>,
      <a href="/poems/31" title="Read “Made When I Was Sick” (Poem 31)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span
        class="t">Made When I Was Sick</span><span class="idx">31</span></a>, or

        class="t">Made When I Was Not Well</span><span class="idx">51</span></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The body’s materiality and therefore its susceptibility to death seems to open a related question for Pulter
      about the mortality of <span class="it">all</span> matter. Pulter often imagines matter in its smallest, most
      fundamental units: dust, atoms, elements. In many poems that use the language of alchemy or otherwise explore
      elemental compositions—see, for instance,
      <a href="/poems/21" title="Read “The Circle [2]” (Poem 21)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">The Circle [2]</span><span
        class="idx">21</span></a>,

         target="_blank"><span class="t">The Invocation of the Elements</span><span class="idx">41</span></a>—the
      speaker wrestles with the question of whether (if at all) such substances also themselves decay and die, or if
      elemental existence offers something permanent—something potentially beyond death itself.

    <h3>Death is spiritual</h3>
    <p>
      But if death was a physical change, Pulter makes clear, it was also definitively a spiritual experience. Across
      the poems, Pulter imagines body and soul locked in a complex relationship with one another. Poems like <a
        href="/poems/34" title="Read “To Aurora [3]” (Poem 34)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">To Aurora [3]</span><span class="idx">34</span></a> often express a sense of frustration at this entanglement, using a familiar rhetoric
      (certainly within Pulter’s poetry) of confinement and disenfranchisement to describe the frustrating experience of
      being an embodied soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speakers of Pulter’s poems frequently speak directly to the soul on the subject of death. In these dialogues,
      they remind their own souls that no matter the decay present in the body, that they are made of something
      different, something more durable. See, for instance,
      <a href="/poems/19" title="Read “The Welcome [1]” (Poem 19)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">The Welcome [1]</span><span
        class="idx">19</span></a>,

        class="t">Made When I Was Sick</span><span class="idx">31</span></a>,
      <a href="/poems/40" title="Read “My Soul, Why Art Thou Full of Trouble?” (Poem 40)" class="pp-poem-ref"
         target="_blank"><span class="t">My Soul, Why Art Thou Full of Trouble?</span><span class="idx">40</span></a>,
      <a href="/poems/42" title="Read “Pardon Me, My Dearest Love” (Poem 42)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span
        class="t">Pardon Me, My Dearest Love</span><span class="idx">42</span></a>,
      <a href="/poems/48" title="Read “Immense Fount of Truth, Life, Love, Joy, Glory” (Poem 48)" class="pp-poem-ref"
         target="_blank"><span class="t">Immense Fount of Truth, Life, Love, Joy, Glory</span><span
        class="idx">48</span></a>, or
      <a href="/poems/49" title="Read “My Heart, Why Dost Thou Throb So in My Breast?” (Poem 49)" class="pp-poem-ref"
         target="_blank"><span class="t">My Heart, Why Dost Thou Throb So in My Breast?</span><span
        class="idx">49</span></a>.
      The shared rhetorical strategy in many of these poems—words of reassurance to a worried soul—creates an
      overarching sense not of confidence, but of doubt. The lyrics become performances not of a speaker offering
      reassurance about the immortality of the soul, but of a speaker working to convince the reader (and herself) that
      the spiritual part of her being really is immune from death.

    <h3>Death is personal</h3>
    <p>
      One of the features that has drawn so many readers to Pulter’s work in recent years is the strong sense of
      personal voice in these lyrics. As Pulter discusses death, she does so frequently from a first-person perspective,
      offering a lyric speaker who is able to articulate the experience of wrestling with their own mortality. Many of
      these take the form of dialogue poems, in which the speaker calls out to God in her despair. In poems such as
      <a href="/poems/20" title="Read “Dear God, Turn Not Away Thy Face” (Poem 20)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span
        class="t">Dear God, Turn Not Away Thy Face</span><span class="idx">20</span></a>,
      <a href="/poems/63" title="Read “Dear God, From Thy High Throne Look Down” (Poem 63)" class="pp-poem-ref"
         target="_blank"><span class="t">Dear God, From Thy High Throne Look Down</span><span class="idx">63</span></a>,
      or
      <a href="/poems/48" title="Read “Immense Fount of Truth, Life, Love, Joy, Glory” (Poem 48)" class="pp-poem-ref"
         target="_blank"><span class="t">Immense Fount of Truth, Life, Love, Joy, Glory</span><span
        class="idx">48</span></a>,
      Pulter engages the conventions of 17th-century devotional lyric, in ways that often recall works by Donne or
      Herbert. In these devotional works, death and poetry begin to become intertwined. Both offer a meeting ground in
      which an individual might, finally, come face to face with God.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while the sense of individual identity that can be formed by meditating on death can be comforting, as some
      of these devotional lyrics suggest, it can also be deeply alienating. In Pulter’s works, the deaths of those
      around her leave her increasingly alone. In poems like
      <a href="/poems/3" title="Read “Aurora [1]” (Poem 3)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Aurora [1]</span><span class="idx">3</span></a> or
      <a href="/poems/28" title="Read “O, My Afflicted Solitary Soul” (Poem 28)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">O, My Afflicted Solitary Soul</span><span class="idx">28</span></a>, or
      in the many poems mourning the loss of her children, Pulter highlights a feeling of isolation as one of the primary manifestations of grief. Each death leaves her more and more alone, she writes; death becomes a kind of social erosion, with each loss further erasing the bonds linking Pulter with her family and her community.

    </ul>


    <h3>Death is communal</h3>
    <p>
      But while death could destroy these personal connections, Pulter also recognized that some deaths could in fact
      create stronger social bonds. In her reflections on the violence of the English Civil War, Pulter often
      concentrates on the very public deaths of George Lisle, Charles Lucas, and King Charles in poems such as
      <a href="/poems/7" title="Read “On those Two Unparalleled Friends” (Poem 7)" class="pp-poem-ref"
         target="_blank"><span class="t">On those Two Unparalleled Friends</span><span class="idx">7</span></a>,
      <a href="/poems/8" title="Read “On That Unparalleled Prince Charles the First, His Horrid Murder” (Poem 8)"
         class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">On That Unparalleled Prince Charles the First, His Horrid Murder</span><span
        class="idx">8</span></a>,
      <a href="/poems/14" title="Read “On the Horrid Murder of that Incomparable Prince” (Poem 14)" class="pp-poem-ref"
         target="_blank"><span class="t">On the Horrid Murder of that Incomparable Prince</span><span
        class="idx">14</span></a>, or
      <a href="/poems/15" title="Read “Let None Sigh More for Lucas or for Lisle” (Poem 15)" class="pp-poem-ref"
         target="_blank"><span class="t">Let None Sigh More for Lucas or for Lisle</span><span class="idx">15</span></a>.
      These deaths reverberated beyond themselves, representing not only an individual but a collective loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such communal losses often led Pulter to explore the memorial functions of lyric poetry. In these poems, the
      speaker calls for the nation to grieve and remember. By doing so, Pulter allows her work to become a monument to
      these notable figures, spaces in which some part of the dead might live on. Particularly in the context of the
      Civil War, this was a deeply political act, in every sense of the word; Pulter’s poems on these deaths work to
      transform individual loss into an opportunity to reconstitute the communal bonds of nationhood.

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Death is destructive</h3>
    <p>
      Many of Pulter’s poems depict death as an undeniably destructive force. Such destruction is often depicted as
      senseless, without any immediate or obvious benefit. Death destroys not only Pulter’s youth and body (see for
      instance, <a href="/poems/51" title="Read “Made When I Was Not Well” (Poem 51)" class="pp-poem-ref"
                   target="_blank"><span class="t">Made When I Was Not Well</span><span class="idx">51</span></a>) but
      the lives of many of her children (see, for instance,
      <a href="/poems/10" title="Read “Upon the Death of my Dear and Lovely Daughter, Jane Pulter” (Poem 10)"
         class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span
        class="t">Upon the Death of my Dear and Lovely Daughter, Jane Pulter</span><span class="idx">10</span></a>,
      <a href="/poems/11" title="Read “Tell Me No More” (Poem 11)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Tell Me No More</span><span
        class="idx">11</span></a>, or
      <a href="/poems/28" title="Read “O, My Afflicted Solitary Soul” (Poem 28)" class="pp-poem-ref"
         target="_blank"><span class="t">O, My Afflicted Solitary Soul</span><span class="idx">28</span></a>).
      The prevalence of grief across Pulter’s poems is a clear indication of death’s devastation; the speakers of these
      poems find themselves in mourning for all that death has taken from them and from the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, however, the destruction wrought by death was not purposeless, but instrumental. In poems such as
      <a href="/poems/49" title="Read “My Heart, Why Dost Thou Throb So in My Breast?” (Poem 49)" class="pp-poem-ref"
         target="_blank"><span class="t">My Heart, Why Dost Thou Throb So in My Breast?</span><span
        class="idx">49</span></a>,
      <a href="/poems/16" title="Read “The Revolution” (Poem 16)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">The Revolution</span><span
        class="idx">16</span></a>,
      <a href="/poems/21" title="Read “The Circle [2]” (Poem 21)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">The Circle [2]</span><span

        class="t">View But This Tulip</span><span class="idx">105</span></a>,
      death is compared to the processes of calcination or alchemical refinement. Destruction here becomes a concurrent
      act of re-creation, a furnace in which the phoenix-like speakers of the poems might be consumed and remade. In
      such poems, destruction is entwined, mobius-like, with generation, yielding many of Pulter’s favorite rhyming
      pairs: dissolve/revolve, calcined/refined, create/annihilate.

    <h3>Death is restorative</h3>
    <p>
      As the above examples suggest, Pulter sees in death not only destruction but the potential for restoration—a
      consummation, to echo Hamlet, devoutly to be wished. Sometimes, Pulter describes death as offering the potential
      for enfranchisement and liberation; see, for instance,
      <a href="/poems/19" title="Read “The Welcome [1]” (Poem 19)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">The Welcome [1]</span><span
        class="idx">19</span></a>,

         target="_blank"><span class="t">The Perfection of Patience and Knowledge</span><span class="idx">39</span></a>.
      In these moments, Pulter sees death as the experience that will free her from the many constrictions of life on
      earth: her solitary life at Broadfield, the grief experienced by the loss of her children, and the decay
      associated with embodied life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pulter also often described death as a kind of narrative culmination, a moment in time that would signal the
      conclusion of this earthly life. In poems such as

      the speaker calls for the reader (and, more often, herself) to have patience. This term was frequently used in
      early modern <span class="it">ars moriendi</span> and other descriptions of death to describe the need to accept
      the divine timeline of life and death. To die patiently meant to understand that death was neither to be delayed
      or wished for, but to be experienced at its proper time. In such descriptions, death offered a moment of
      teleological fulfillment—a making whole.

    <h3>Death is unknowable</h3>
    <p>
      Finally, for Pulter, death was inseparable from what lay beyond death: specifically, the hope of resurrection.
      Even as death represented a narrative endpoint to earthly experience, it also offered a transformational new
      beginning, allowing Pulter to imagine a life beyond this one. Poems such as

      showcase the hope that accompanied resurrection in Pulter’s lyric.
    </p>

    <p>
      The nature of the resurrection Pulter imagines, however, is unclear. While in some poems, eternal life is
      presented in dualist tones as the persistence of the spirit beyond the limitations of the body, others offer more
      complicated accounts. In some resurrection poems, for instance, Pulter seems to reference a monist theology of
      bodily resurrection known in the early modern period as soul-sleeping. Echoing the doctrine espoused by Martin
      Luther and several Protestant dissenting groups, in poems such as
      <a href="/poems/11" title="Read “Tell Me No More” (Poem 11)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Tell Me No More</span><span

      the speaker seems to imply that the soul—while not dying, per se—would be kept apart from God until the day of
      final judgement when it was reunited with the body. In such visions, death both was and was not final; liminal
      space emerges between the end of this world and the beginning of the next. </p>
    <p>And in some poems, Pulter seems to question the certainty of resurrection altogether. In poems like
      <a href="/poems/65" title="Read “The Hope” (Poem 65)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span
        class="t">The Hope</span><span class="idx">65</span></a> or

        class="t">View But This Tulip</span><span class="idx">105</span></a>,
      Pulter underwrites the hope for resurrection with the simultaneous realization that such a miracle is,
      necessarily, incomprehensible. For all that Pulter comes to know about death, it seems that one of the final
      lessons is that death—and what comes after—remains unknowable.
