      Hester Pulter was a pioneer amongst women poets in addressing polemical political subjects, but in revolutionary
      times she was not unique. The excerpts below give a sampling of some female contemporaries. How far she was aware
      of their work is hard to say. Most women poets confined themselves as she did to manuscript circulation; but so,
      for the most part, did Marvell, whose work she may have known. Catharine Gray has pointed out that Katherine
      Philips managed to gain a significant place in literary coteries in the early 1650s, and Margaret Cavendish and
      Lucy Hutchinson also had contact with these coteries. But the three case studies below are presented not as likely
      influences but as writers responding to the same political upheavals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Katherine Philips, aged only seventeen in 1649, when Charles II was executed, ran the risk of public male censure
      by taking sides in her verse. She wrote a fiery refutation of a poem by the Puritan minister Vavasour Powell which
      took issue with defenses of the late king. Philips began with a disclaimer acknowledging a traditional view that
      subjects, and still less women, should not take up positions on high politics. But she went on to compare herself
      to the mute son of Croesus who, seeing an assassin advancing on his father, regained the power of speech to warn
      him, and so the disclaimer is “wittily and wonderfully ironic” (Hageman and Sununu, 160). A colleague of Powell’s,
      encountering the poem, threatened to publish it to discredit her husband, a Parliamentarian who, in J. Jones’s
      view, should have made his wife suppress her subversive defense of the royal “cause.” This is a reminder of the
      political constraints that would have encouraged Pulter to be very careful about the circulation of her poems.

      Philips brings into poetry the politico-legal language of Civil War – sequestering common sense rather than
      royalist estates. The incident reveals the tangle of constraints around a woman’s agency as writer, as wife, and
      as loyal subject. If seventeenth-century patriarchal political thought emphasized parallels between loyalty to the
      king and to the head of the household, the revolution potentially opened up conflicts between them. Despite these
      pressures, Philips did publish a poem at the head of a large volume of tributes to the royalist poet William
      Cartwright.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the household of the leading royalist commander William Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle, political and poetic
      loyalties went together. He encouraged women writers in his family including his daughter Jane, whom he left in
      charge of his household at Welbeck in Nottinghamshire. She followed reports of his military campaigns and
      celebrated his victory at Adwalton Moor in 1643:

      Thomas Lord Fairfax, leader of Parliamentarian forces in the north, had mustered formidable troops and met a
      severe setback, along with his son Sir Thomas. Jane Cavendish stresses the religious dimension of the conflict,
      equating support of the king with support of God and Christ. In a garrison surrounded by Parliamentarians, she has
      to keep her thanksgiving poem private.

      Two years later, when royalist defeats had brought him to exile in Paris, William Cavendish would marry Margaret
      Lucas, a lady in waiting to Queen Henrietta Maria, who would later narrate his victory at Adwalton Moor in prose.
      Her brother Charles was a royalist commander whose death at Colchester affected Pulter deeply (see <a

      class="idx">15</span></a>). Margaret Cavendish was involved at a more intimate level, and her two elegies for him,
      while lamenting his treatment by his enemies, are also introspective. The first elegy has Lucas (not identified in
      the first, 1653 publication) speak in his own voice, lamenting his death and burial amongst his enemies, and
      pleading that his tomb should be free from the desecration which soldiers had recently inflicted on the family
      tombs. The poem’s final words echo Lucas’s own words just before his execution: “I would have a decent buriall,
      and that I might be buried by my ancestours, and where they are. Their monuments are not only defac’t, but their
      dead bodies remov’d. Let us from henceforth lye in quiet” (<span class="it">The Clarke Papers</span>, vol. 2, ed.

      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      The fourth stanza opens up a different note of elegiac pathos, signaled by a shift in meter. The whole poem is remarkable for its unprecedented metrical boldness, with the two first lines in each stanza unrhymed and the second two rhymed: perhaps a signal of the death’s disharmony (the rhymes were regularized when the poem was republished in 1664, see Margaret Cavendish’s <a href="//library2.utm.utoronto.ca/poemsandfancies/#" target="_blank"><span class="it">Poems and Fancies</span></a>: A digital critical edition, edited by Liza Blake). Perhaps Cavendish wished to emphasize the impact of her brother’s death, by making even the poem’s calmer resolution discordant. The poem contrasts sharply with many elegies for Lucas and other royalists killed in 1648–9 (see Curation <a href="/poems/ae/let-none-sigh-more-for-lucas-or-for-lisle-on-the-same-2/#arthur-first-baron-capel" class="pp-curation-ref" target="_blank">Arthur, first Baron Capel (1604–49)</a>) in failing to call for action in defense of the royal cause. And in strong contrast to Jane Cavendish, neither in this nor in the other elegy does she say anything about God, or Lucas’s immortal destiny (apart from the fact that his soul is “gone”). Lucy Hutchinson and her allies claimed during the Civil War that the Duke of Newcastle was an atheist (<span class="it">Memoirs of the Life of Colonel Hutchinson</span>, ed. James Sutherland (London: Oxford University Press, 1989), p. 73), and she might from reading this poem have applied the label to his wife – though it has been questioned whether the label fitted her; see Justin Begley, “Margaret Cavendish Reads Josuah Sylvester: Epicurus, Atheism, and Atomic Skepticism in Poems, and Fancies,” <span class="it">English Literary Renaissance</span>,
      53:3 (2023), 376–400.
    </p>

    <p>
      Certainly Hutchinson, as will be seen, had a very different view of Lucas, who attacked the garrison at Nottingham
      which her husband commanded, and the Duke of Newcastle also threatened the city. Despite these political
      differences, Lucy Hutchinson’s writing life often parallelled that of Margaret Cavendish, from writing chronicles
      of their husbands’ activities in the Civil War to an interest in new theories of the atom. It has often been
      argued that royalism, with its openness to female patronage at court, offered a more favorable climate for women
      writers than the Puritan emphasis on subordination in the household, and certainly Lucy Hutchinson did not openly
      champion women as writers in print as Cavendish did. However, in the Hutchinsons’ exploratory household, as part
      of a classic Puritan “companionate marriage,” patriarchal authority was combined with encouragement of women’s
      writing and other artistic activities, without any reliance on kings or courts. If Arthur, Lord Capel could invoke
      a patriarchal theory by which obedience to the king was part of a divinely ordained duty to the father, the
      Hutchinson household affirmed the father without the king. Though John Hutchinson was first drawn to his future
      wife by encountering her fine poetry, with the outbreak of war in 1642 she found herself turning her verbal skills
      to a very different use as his secretary and propagandist, composing a defense of his actions against enemies on
      the local Parliamentary committee. This work may, Anna Wall argues, have been intended as a print pamphlet, part
      of the escalating literature of conflict which Pulter so deplored. The Hutchinsons were on diametrically opposite
      sides to their Nottinghamshire neighbor William Cavendish, who in 1643 led troops close to the city and tried to
      persuade Colonel Hutchinson to surrender. The following year Sir Charles Lucas led a force into Nottingham.
      Hutchinson offers a very different image of him from the royalists, and shows the agency of women amongst the
      citizens:

        The Commander in cheife of all the forces that came against this Towne was S<sup>r</sup> Charles Lucas. there
        were aboue a thousand that came into Towne with him and as many more that stayed in a body without the Towne, to
        haue fought with Derby force if they had come to our reliefe. Hastings, with all his owne Belvoir and Wiverton
        force, faced the Trent Bridges on the other side themselues, & others report that all the force they had about
        the Towne was betweene 2 and 3000. S<sup>r</sup> Charles Lucas had written a letter to the Governor to demand of
        him the Castle, or if he would not deliuer it that he should send downe the Mayer & Aldermen or elce threatned
        that he would sacke and burne the Towne: & when he could find none that durst venture to bring vp this letter,

        she was out of doores they cried out the roundheads were salliing forth, whereupon she flung away the letter and
        ranne away from them, and they ran as fast out of Towne from 400 souldiers that furiously came vpon them out of
        the Castle.

    <p>
      If Hutchinson wrote any poems about Civil War campaigns they have not survived, but one passage in her later
      biography of her husband reads like a republican response to the genre of royalist poetry about the Second Civil
      War and regicide (1648–9) to which Cavendish, Philips and Pulter had contributed. She had probably read some of
      the elegies for Colonel Thomas Rainsborough, who had been at Colchester and was blamed by some for the deaths of
      Lucas and Lisle. A group of royalists captured him, unarmed, in his lodgings and killed him, an act which provoked
      Parliamentarian outrage and a wave of elegies. Writing after the Restoration — though perhaps following an earlier
      draft — Lucy Hutchinson commemorated a less well-known death of 1648, when John Hutchinson’s close friend and ally
      Francis Thornhagh was killed in a skirmish with Scottish royalists who were moving southwards. Cromwell’s forces
      stopped them, thus preventing them from relieving Colchester; Lucas’s execution came ten days after Thornhagh’s
      death on 18 August, and Hamilton would be executed on the same day as Capel.
    </p>

    <div class="q">

      <p>
        [I]n the beginning of this battle the Valliant Collonell Thornhagh was wounded to death. Being at the beginning
        of the charge upon a horse as couragious as became such a master, he made such furious speed to sett upon a
        company of Scotch Lanciers that he was singly engaged and mortally wounded before it was possible for his
        regiment, though as brave men as euer drew sword and too afectionate to their Collonell to be slack in following
        him, to come time enough to breake the furie of that body, which sham’d not to unite all their force against one
        man; who yet fell not among them, but being faint and all cover’d with blood, as well of his enemies as his
        owne, was carried off by some of his owne men, while the rest, enrag’d for the losse of their deare Collonell,
        fought not that day like men of humane race. Deafe to the cries of euery coward that askt mercy, they kill’d
        all, and would not a captive [should] live to see their Collonell die, but sayd the whole kingdome of Scotland
        was too meane a sacrifice for that brave man, whose soule was hovering to take her flight out of his body, but
        that an eager desire to know the successe of that battle kept it within till the end of the day; when, the newes
        being brought him, he clear’d his dying countenance, and sayd, “I now rejoyce to die, since God hath lett me see
        the overthrow of this perfidious enemie; I could not loose my life in a better cause, and I have the favour from
        the Lord to see my blood aveng’d.” So he died, with a large testimony of love to his souldiers, but more to the
        cause, and was by mercy remoov’d, that the temptations of future times might not prevaile to corrupt his pure
        soule. A man of greater courage and integritie fought not, nor fell not in this glorious cause. He had alsoe an
        excellent good nature, but easie to be wrought upon by flatterers, yett as flexible to the admonitions of his
        friends; and this vertue he had, that if sometimes a cunning insinuation prevail’d upon his easie faith, when
        his error was made knowne to him, notwithstanding all his greate courage, he was readier to acknowledge and
        repaire than to persue his mistakes.

      This episode brings out the savagery of the Second Civil War, with Parliamentarians furious at the royalists for
      taking up arms after pledging to lay them down, as well as the strong anti-Scots feelings of many English
      soldiers. It also evokes the intense culture of news, with Thornhagh’s soul reluctant to leave his body until he
      hears news of the battle’s outcome. Three times the word “cause” appears: for Parliamentarians, allegiance is to
      an abstract cause, a set of principles, rather than a personal monarch (contrast Philips above on cause and king).
      Hutchinson’s truth-telling aesthetic leads her to qualify the rhetoric of praise with criticisms of Thornhagh,
      even though they are modulated by the serpentine syntax.

      Of these writers, Hutchinson was for a time closest in sympathy to the Leveller movement of political reform. From
      the start of the Civil War, some women had started to present petitions, and in 1649 a petition from Leveller
      women, rallying support for a previous manifesto, began with a ringing declaration of women’s equality before God
      and their at least “proportionable” share of liberty in the state. Women were appointed to get signatures for such
      petitions from each ward in London. The combination of practical organization with large claims of principle
      marked a truly revolutionary step. By the spring of 1649 Lilburne was organizing against the republic and the
      Hutchinsons had turned against the Levellers, while Pulter had been shocked by such petitions from the start -
      compare her reference to Essex as "the first who had the bold commission / From cannon’s mouth to thunder out
      petitions"? ("On the Fall of that Grand Rebel" [Poem 62], lines 17–18). And yet the growing polarization of the
      culture, with demands for broader public participation from both sides, brought in poets as well as petitioners.
