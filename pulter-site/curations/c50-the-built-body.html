    <p>George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1611 until his death in 1633, offers readers a detailed paraphrase of the book of Job. In the passage selected here, he expands upon Job 10.8-10.13, with the biblical verses (from the <span class="it">King James Bible</span>) reproduced in the margin (in charmingly mangled form in 10.10). Abbot’s version emphasises the idea of man’s body as being built by God, and vulnerable to his will.</p>

    <p>Shakespeare’s sonnet, transcribed here from its first printing in 1609, asks the reader to reflect upon her own mortality. The soul is described as the centre of the speaker’s “earth,” playing with ideas of the shape and substance of the world but also with the body as dust or clay. The body which sustains the speaker rebels against him, prompting him to ask why he spends so much on his bodily exterior (imagined as the “outward walls” of a “fading mansion”), whilst neglecting his soul. Rather than fattening a body which will only go to feed worms, the sonnet suggests, both speaker and reader should starve their bodies in order that their souls may thrive.</p>
