    <p>These texts help to contextualize Pulter’s decision to think about human bodily and spiritual life by means of plants, both in this poem and in others. Many writers preceding and contemporary to Pulter link poetry and posies (or bouquets) and use flowers as analogues for human feelings, mortality, fragility, and beauty.</p>
    <p>What is a posie?</p>

      <p>There be also other like epigrams that were sent usually for new year’s gifts or to be printed or put upon their banqueting dishes of sugar plate or of marchpane [marzipan] and such other dainty meats, as by the courtesy and custom of every guest might carry from a common feast home with him to his own house, and were made for the nonce.  They were called nenia or apophereta [funeral songs and favors given to guests], and never contained above one verse, or two at the most, but the shorter the better.  We call them posies, and do paint them nowadays upon the backsides of our fruit trenchers of wood, or use them as devices in rings and arms and about such courtly purposes. </p>

    <p>Critics discuss the flower/writing connection:</p>

    <div class="q">
      <p>“The posy is the form that poetry takes in its fully material, visual mode, as it exists in its moment, at a particular site. Paradoxically, such poetry is portable (‘something to be carried away’) precisely because it has not achieved, and does not hope to achieve, the immaterial, abstracted status of the infinitely transmissible text.”</p>
      <p>“The recurrence of flowers in Elizabethan wall paintings may thus be less ‘naturalistic’ than it seems today:  the flower is a flower of rhetoric, while a collection of flowers on a wall (a posy) is a figure for a text … While today these appear as inverted metaphors or conceits, painted flowers once expressed that fusion between figure and thing that Foucault takes to be characteristic of early modern thought.”</p>

    </div>

    <div class="q">
      <p>“It is hard to spend any amount of time looking at early modern books without noticing how many are presented through their titular metaphors as well as their prefatory rhetoric as forms of vegetable material:  as gardens, and orchards, or posies, and forests, to name only some among the many variations on this long-standing ligature between plants and texts.”</p>
      <p>“I begin this book by asking … why and how early modern people might have seen–and so, in the broadest sense, have read–texts differently when volumes appeared before them veiled in the verdant atmosphere projected by such metaphors.”</p>

      <p><span class="place-above">1</span> Mary Thomas Crane, points out that the tagline “curiously, defeats the purpose of this volume by admitting that he has not learned from his troubles. Although we might expect his posies to present conventional moral judgments on the experience recounted in the poems, they do not do so. Instead, they tend to express continued immersion in experience and an inability to gather definite lessons from it” (<span class="it">Framing Authority: Sayings, Self, and Society in Sixteenth-Century England</span> [Princeton University Press, 1993], p. 178).</p>

    <p>Like Pulter’s “View but this Tulip” and other poems, especially “The Garden,” this sonnet uses the close observation of flowers and plants as a trigger for broader reflections on human life and longing. This sonnet also shares the “if then” structure of Pulter’s “View but this Tulip.” Here the teleology is secular:  if we always find sweet tempered with sour in the botanical world, the speaker asks him or her self, then why should I mind the pain suffered in pursuit of the “endless pleasure” of love?  Spenser presents a kind of logical proof of how one might think through an emotional puzzle, as Pulter will later do. Other Spenser sonnets can be found in “Pulter and the English Blazon” in “Explorations.”</p>

        <li class="l t-4">Where all things burn,</li>

        <li class="l t-2">These are thy wonders, Lord of love,</li>
        <li class="l">To make us see we are but flowers that glide,</li>
        <li class="l t-2">Which when we once can find and prove,</li>
        <li class="l">Thou hast a garden for us where to bide;</li>
        <li class="l t-4">Who would be more,</li>
        <li class="l t-4">Swelling through store,</li>
        <li class="l t-2">Forfeit their Paradise by their pride.</li>
