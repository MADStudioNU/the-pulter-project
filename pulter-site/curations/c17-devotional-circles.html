    <p>
      George Herbert’s “A Wreath,” Henry Vaughan’s “The World” and Andrew Marvell’s “The Coronet” reveal some of the devotional symbolism of circles for Pulter’s predecessors and peers.

        <li class="l">And round beneath it, Time in hours, days, years,</li>
        <li class="l">Driv’n by the spheres</li>

        <li class="l">And all her train were hurl’d.</li>
        <li class="l">The doting lover in his quaintest strain</li>
        <li class="l">Did there complain;</li>
        <li class="l">Near him, his lute, his fancy, and his flights,</li>
        <li class="l">Wit’s sour delights,</li>
        <li class="l">With gloves, and knots, the silly snares of pleasure,</li>
        <li class="l">Yet his dear treasure</li>
        <li class="l">All scatter’d lay, while he his eyes did pour</li>
        <li class="l">Upon a flow’r.</li>

        <li class="l">The darksome statesman hung with weights and woe,</li>
        <li class="l">Like a thick midnight-fog mov’d there so slow,</li>
        <li class="l">He did not stay, nor go;</li>
        <li class="l">Condemning thoughts (like sad eclipses) scowl</li>
        <li class="l">Upon his soul,</li>
        <li class="l">And clouds of crying witnesses without</li>
        <li class="l">Pursued him with one shout.</li>
        <li class="l">Yet digg’d the mole, and lest his ways be found,</li>
        <li class="l">Work’d under ground,</li>
        <li class="l">Where he did clutch his prey; but one did see</li>
        <li class="l">That policy;</li>
        <li class="l">Churches and altars fed him; perjuries</li>
        <li class="l">Were gnats and flies;</li>
        <li class="l">It rain’d about him blood and tears, but he</li>
        <li class="l">Drank them as free.</li>

        <li class="l">The fearful miser on a heap of rust</li>
        <li class="l">Sate pining all his life there, did scarce trust</li>
        <li class="l">His own hands with the dust,</li>
        <li class="l">Yet would not place one piece above, but lives</li>
        <li class="l">In fear of thieves;</li>
        <li class="l">Thousands there were as frantic as himself,</li>
        <li class="l">And hugg’d each one his pelf;</li>
        <li class="l">The downright epicure plac’d heav’n in sense,</li>
        <li class="l">And scorn’d pretence,</li>
        <li class="l">While others, slipp’d into a wide excess,</li>
        <li class="l">Said little less;</li>
        <li class="l">The weaker sort slight, trivial wares enslave,</li>
        <li class="l">Who think them brave;</li>
        <li class="l">And poor despised Truth sat counting by</li>
        <li class="l">Their victory.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="lg">
        <li class="l">Yet some, who all this while did weep and sing,</li>
        <li class="l">And sing, and weep, soar’d up into the ring;</li>
        <li class="l">But most would use no wing.</li>
        <li class="l">O fools (said I) thus to prefer dark night</li>
        <li class="l">Before true light,</li>
        <li class="l">To live in grots and caves, and hate the day</li>
        <li class="l">Because it shews the way,</li>
        <li class="l">The way, which from this dead and dark abode</li>
        <li class="l">Leads up to God,</li>
        <li class="l">A way where you might tread the sun, and be</li>
        <li class="l">More bright than he.</li>
        <li class="l">But as I did their madness so discuss</li>
        <li class="l">One whisper’d thus,</li>
        <li class="l">“This ring the Bridegroom did for none provide,</li>
        <li class="l">But for his bride.”</li>

          <li class="l">Though set with skill and chosen out with care:</li>
          <li class="l">That they, while Thou on both their spoils dost tread,</li>
