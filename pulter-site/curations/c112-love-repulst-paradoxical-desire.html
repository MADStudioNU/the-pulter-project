      <p>Pulter’s advice for women, “Love Repulst doth more increase desire” (19), is part of the broader features of Renaissance rape culture. <span class="it">Rape culture</span> is a sociological concept originating with second-wave feminism in the 1970s that identifies the normalization of (male) sexual violence and the blame placed on victims of sexual assault. Kay Stanton discusses the pressing connections between contemporary rape culture and our early modern antecedents in <span class="it">Shakespeare/Sex: Contemporary Readings in Gender and Sexuality</span>.<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-0-1" id="fna-0-1">1</a> In many early modern renderings of rape culture, the more a woman resists sexual advances, the more enticing she becomes to her attacker, “As Oyl Thrown on to quench augments the fire” (20). Compare Pulter’s treatment of this sentiment to the following examples:</p>
      
      <p>Note when Daphne appears “most lovely” to Apollo in Ovid’s <span class="it">Metamorphoses</span>. Apollo’s inability to catch the elusive Daphne even drives him “mad.” How does this relate to the turtle’s pursuit in Pulter’s poem?</p>
      
      <div class="q">
          <ul class="lg">
              <li class="l">Lovely the virgin seemed as the soft wind</li>
              <li class="l">exposed her limbs, and as the zephyrs fond</li>
              <li class="l">fluttered amid her garments, and the breeze</li>
              <li class="l">fanned lightly in her flowing hair. She seemed</li>
              <li class="l">most lovely to his fancy in her flight;</li>
              <li class="l">and mad with love he followed in her steps,</li>
              <li class="l">and silent hastened his increasing speed.</li>
          </ul>

      <p>Note how Pulter describes the turtle’s paramour as “wise,” “fair,” and “chaste.” How does this relate to the way Angelo in Shakespeare’s <span class="it">Measure for Measure</span> (1604) describes Isabella’s “modesty” and “virtue”?</p>
      
      <div class="q">
          <ul class="lg">
              <li class="l">ANGELO:</li>
              <li class="l">Can it be</li>
              <li class="l">That modesty may more betray our sense</li>
              <li class="l">Than woman’s lightness?</li>
              <li class="l">...</li>
              <li class="l">Never could the strumpet,</li>
              <li class="l">With all her double vigour, art and nature,</li>
              <li class="l">Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid</li>
              <li class="l">Subdues me quite.</li>

      <p>Note how Pulter’s pursued turtle layers love with fear, as one emotion overtakes and then subsumes the other: “Thus Love then fear did prove more Swift in Chase” (13). How does DeFlores in Middleton’s <span class="it">The Changeling</span> (1622) use a similar relationship between love and fear (and the “turtle,” here in reference to a turtledove) to introduce this coercive sexual encounter with Beatrice Joanna?</p>

      <p>Note how Pulter’s male turtle requests both “Love, and pitty” (4). How does this relate to the way the Duke in Middleton’s <span class="it">Women Beware Women</span> (c. 1623) discusses pity, affection, and pleasure?</p>
      
      <div class="q">
          <ul class="lg">
