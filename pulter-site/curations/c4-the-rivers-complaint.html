      It is a common poetic trope to imagine rivers not only as physical waterways but also as expressive agents whose murmuring flow seems to voice the conditions of the landscapes they traverse and the histories they carry, a feature present from classical pastoral poetry to our contemporary poetry. In <a href="/poems/4" title="Read “The Complaint of Thames, 1647” (Poem 4)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">The Complaint of Thames</span><span class="idx">4</span></a>, Pulter participates from this literary tradition by personifying the River Thames and granting it a female voice that articulates the sorrows of the nation. Personified, lamenting rivers occupy a generically rich intersection of pastoral poetry, river poetry, and the tradition of the lyric complaint. The fusion of landscape, lament, and poetic voice in this tradition makes the river, its flow and its sounds, a potent metaphor for both personal and political grief. In classical pastoral poetry, poets frequently position themselves beside a body of water, typically a river, spring, or fountain, not merely as a scenic convention, but as a site of poetic inspiration. This motif draws on the classical belief that the Muses resided in or were associated with bodies of water, particularly sacred springs such as the Castalian Spring at Delphi, long regarded as a source of divine poetic insight and that was one of the central features of Greek and Roman pastoral poetry, These motives were reworked during the early modern period, and continue to resonate in the presence of rivers in contemporary poetry, situating Pulter’s <a href="/poems/4" title="Read “The Complaint of Thames, 1647” (Poem 4)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">The Complaint of Thames</span><span class="idx">4</span></a> within a broader literary tradition of complaining rivers, which this curation seeks to explore.

      Within the pastoral tradition, laments for the dead are a recurring motif. These elegiac pastorals often intertwine mourning with depictions of the natural world, employing elements of nature—trees, rivers, birds—as agents or mirrors of grief. A notable example appears in the work of the Greek bucolic poet Moschus (C2nd BCE), whose lament for the death of his fellow poet Bion exemplifies this convention. In the poem, a withering nature mourns: trees lose their fruit, rivers are transformed into tears, and swans sing dirges upon the water. The rivers’ grief is often symbolically expressed through their estuaries, where fresh waters that are lost in the sea serve as images of dissolution and sorrow.

      <p>
        Cry woe, you glades and you Dorian waters; you rivers, weep for lovely Bion. Lament now, you plants that grow; moan now, you groves; you flowers, breathe your last, your clusters withered; you roses and anemones, bloom red now in mourning; you hyacinth, make your letters speak and take on your leaves more cries of woe: the fine singer is dead.
      </p>

      <p><span class="it">Begin, Sicilian Muses, begin your grieving song.</span></p>

      <p>You nightingales that lament among the dense foliage, bear news to the Sicilian streams of Arethusa that Bion the oxherd is dead; that with him song too has died, and Dorian minstrelsy has perished.</p>

      <p><span class="it">Begin, Sicilian Muses, begin your grieving song.</span></p>

      <p>You swans of Strymon, cry woe beside your waters; with your lamenting voices sing a dirge such as old age produces from your throats.</p>

      <p>(...)</p>

      <p>[I]n the woods nymphs of the spring lamented, and their water was turned to tears. Echo laments among the rocks because she is silent and can imitate the sounds from your lips no more. To honor your death, the trees have dropped their fruit and every flower has withered; fair milk has ceased to flow from the flocks, and honey from the hives; it perished for grief in the comb: there is no more need to gather it, now that your honey has died away.</p>

      <p>(...)</p>

      <p>This is a second grief, a fresh grief for you, Meles, most musical of rivers. It is not long since the death of your poet Homer, sweet mouthpiece of Calliope; they say that from your lamenting waters you made moan for your fine son, and the whole sea was filled with the sound of your voice. Now you weep again for another son and dissolve with fresh grief.</p>

      Motifs of withering and mourning nature also recur in Pulter’s poems. For her, water is a powerful element through which to embody grief. Tears recur in her poems as capsules of lament—watery forms produced by the human body that, within an intimate register, mirror a broader geography of sorrow that she perceives in rivers. In several of her poems, such as <a href="/poems/2" title="Read “The Invitation into the Country, 1647” (Poem 2)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">The Invitation into the Country</span><span class="idx">2</span></a>, <a href="/poems/4" title="Read “The Complaint of Thames, 1647” (Poem 4)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">The Complaint of Thames</span><span class="idx">4</span></a>, <a href="/poems/15" title="Read “Let None Sigh More for Lucas or for Lisle” (Poem 15)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Let None Sigh More for Lucas or for Lisle</span><span class="idx">15</span></a>, and <a href="/poems/120" title="Read “Somnus, Why Art Thou Still To Me Unkind” (Poem 120)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Somnus, Why Art Thou Still to Me Unkind?</span><span class="idx">120</span></a>, rivers carry both national and personal laments, tied to the deposition of Charles I, the loss of friends during the Civil War, and Pulter’s own reflections on her life.

      The classical pastoral tradition enjoyed popular reception during the English Renaissance. Poets frequently deployed this genre to express grief, paradigmatically in response to the death of Sir Philip Sidney, which inspired a number of elegiac pastorals featuring river motifs. One such example appears in Edmund Spenser’s <span class="it">Colin Clouts Come Home Againe</span> (1595), in the interpolated poem “The Mourning Muse of Thestylis” by the Irish poet Lodowick Bryskett. In this lament, the poet imagines his tears of grief mixing with those of the nymphs, flowing into the sounds and waters of the River Liffey. This river is joined by other European rivers, including the Thames, in a collective act of mourning for the loss of the poet and courtly hero.

      River motifs extended beyond the bounds of elegiac poetry and found resonance in the Renaissance complaint tradition. The poetic form of the complaint, often embedded within sonnet sequences, typically featured a female speaker lamenting the betrayal or loss of a lover. This tradition is modeled on Ovid’s <span class="it">Heroides</span>, a collection of elegiac epistles in which mythological women address absent or unfaithful lovers. In the English literary tradition, examples include Samuel Daniel’s “Complaint of Rosamund” in <span class="it">Delia</span> (1592), Thomas Lodge’s “Complaint of Elstred” in <span class="it">Phillis</span> (1593), Richard Barnfield’s “Cassandra” in <span class="it">Cynthia</span> (1595), and William Shakespeare’s “A Lover’s Complaint,” in his <span class="it">Sonnets</span> (1609). In the opening scene of Shakespeare’s poem, a young woman is situated beside a riverbank, casting letters and love tokens into the water. Observed from a distance by a male onlooker, she recounts the narrative of her seduction and abandonment:

      The complaint tradition is a key influence on Pulter’s poem, but as we have seen up to this point, the river typically serves as a backdrop for lamenting the loss of a friend or the departure of a lover. By the 1610s, however, we begin to see a more focused poetic interest in rivers as subjects in their own right, a shift that Pulter will creatively rework in the 1640s within the new political context shaped by the Civil War. As well as the better known river poem <span class="it">Poly-Olbion</span> by Michael Drayton (1612), another notable poem foregrounding rivers and aquatic imagery is <span class="it">Britannia’s Pastorals</span> by the English poet William Browne (1614).
    </p>

    <p>
      In <span class="it">Britannia’s Pastorals</span>, Browne situates a pastoral lament after a love rejection within a fluvial setting, where the Thames and Medway take on heightened metaphorical significance. These rivers embody overwhelming emotional forces, mirroring the shepherd’s grief over the lover’s rejection, his tears becoming floods that echo the rivers’ own power to inundate.

        <li class="l">Thus oftentimes unto himself alone</li>

        <li class="l">Rather than his grandame Earth should clean involve</li>

      Pulter adopts the complaint form but transforms it by allowing the river itself to speak, whereas in the traditional pastoral poems we have seen above, humans lament beside a stream, or mourning is figured through metaphors of flowing waters. Pulter transforms this genre by giving the river its own voice, reshaping motifs of the personal losses of friends or lovers into a political grievance: the loss of the King.
    </p>

    <p>
      The motif of the river’s complaint persists beyond the early modern period. In his 2019 poem “Complaint of El Río Grande,” American poet Richard Blanco reimagines this tradition by giving voice to the Rio Grande. The river articulates a history that precedes human time and resists the imposition of national borders—specifically, the geopolitical line dividing the United States, where the river is denominated Rio Grande and Mexico, where it is called Río Bravo. Like Pulter’s poetic engagements with riverine voices, Blanco’s work mobilizes the figure of the speaking river to interrogate the entanglements of nature and nationhood. While their aims diverge, both poets employ the trope of the river’s lament to reflect on how human societies inhabit, transform, and inscribe meaning onto the natural world through sociopolitical structures.
