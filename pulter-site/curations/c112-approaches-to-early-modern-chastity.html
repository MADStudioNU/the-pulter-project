      <p>In <a href="/poems/112" title="Read “The Turtle and his Paramour” (Emblem 47)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t"> The Turtle and his Paramour (Emblem 47)</span><span class="idx">112</span></a>, Pulter advises her women readers that “Nothing gains love like virgin Modestie” (18). But if the “love” you get looks uncomfortably like rape, then the poem seems to be critiquing whether laboring to preserve virgin modesty is worth the trouble. Chastity, in contrast, is mentioned three times in the poem, and is upheld as a constant model for her women readers. Chastity was not equivalent to virginity. As Bonnie Lander Johnson notes in her study <span class="it">Chastity in Early Stuart Literature and Culture</span>, “Virginity was an anatomical state that preceded sexual activity; chastity was a state, both spiritual and psychological, that could be observed through all stages of a person’s adult life.”<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-0-1" id="fna-0-1">1</a></p>
      <p>Notably, “chaste” and “chased” also function as an aural pun in <a href="/poems/112" title="Read “The Turtle and his Paramour” (Emblem 47)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t"> The Turtle and his Paramour (Emblem 47)</span><span class="idx">112</span></a>, connecting the poem’s two major themes.</p>
      <p>Consider the way chastity was discussed as a guiding virtue for early modern women:</p>
      <p>Jean Luis Vives’ advice manual <span class="it">The Education of a Christian Woman</span> (1529) assigns the utmost importance to a woman’s chastity:</p>
      
      <div class="q">
          <p>In a woman, chastity is the equivalent of all virtues … if that is safe, everything else will be in safety; if that is lost, all things perish together with it.</p>

      <p>Jane Anger’s biting advice in <span class="it">Her Protection for Women</span> (1589) highlights the double standard to which women and their chastity were held:</p>
      
      <div class="q">
          <p>Our virginitie makes us vertuous, our conditions curteous, & our chastitie maketh our truenesse of love manifest. They confesse we are necessarie, but they would have us likewise evil.</p>

      <p>Edmund Spenser’s <span class="it">The Faerie Queene</span> (1590) calls chastity “That fairest vertue, farre aboue the rest” and praises chastity as a crowning glory akin to a heavenly halo: </p>
      
      <div class="q">
          <ul class="lg">
              <li class="l">With this faire flowre your goodly girlonds dight,</li>

      <p>Shakespeare upholds the value of chastity as a form of loyalty in his “The Phoenix and the Turtle” (1601), but also mourns the dearth of issue that results from its enforced practice:</p>
      
      <div class="q">
          <ul class="lg">
              <li class="l">Death is now the Phoenix’ nest,</li>
              <li class="l">And the Turtle’s loyal breast</li>
              <li class="l">To eternity doth rest,</li>
          </ul>
          
          <ul class="lg">
              <li class="l">Leaving no posterity:</li>
              <li class="l">’Twas not their infirmity,</li>
              <li class="l">It was married chastity.</li>
          </ul>

      <p>Like Pulter, Aemelia Lanyer notes that chastity often serves as an enticement to wayward men. In her “Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum” (1611), she lists a number of historical, mythological, and biblical women—including Helen and Cleopatra—whose chastity (and by proxy, beauty) proved to be their undoing:</p>
      
      <div class="q">
          <ul class="lg">
              <li class="l">For greatest perils do attend the fair,</li>
              <li class="l">When men do seek, attempt, plot, and devise,</li>
              <li class="l">How they may overthrow the chastest dame,</li>
              <li class="l">Whose beauty is the white whereat they aim.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="q-block bottom">

          </div>
      </div>
      
      <p>Now explore the treatment of chastity and virginity in some of Pulter’s other emblem poetry. Where do the concepts of chastity and virginity overlap? Where do they diverge?</p>
      
      <p>Pulter’s <a href="/poems/80" title="Read “The Stately Unicorn” (Emblem 14)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t"> The Stately Unicorn (Emblem 14)</span><span class="idx">80</span></a> uses the legend of the unicorn and the virgin’s protective power to warn of the dangers of alluring women. What kind of power is given to virginity, and how does this differ from the power afforded to chastity?</p>
      
      <p>Pulter’s <a href="/poems/84" title="Read “The Elephant” (Emblem 19)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t"> The Elephant (Emblem 19)</span><span class="idx">84</span></a> praises the elephant’s constancy as a form of chastity: “Then yet be chaste, and those you choose in youth, Love constantly, for Truth deserveth truth.” Are chastity and constancy synonymous?</p>
      
      <p>Likewise, Pulter’s <a href="/poems/99" title="Read “Mark but those Hogs” (Emblem 34)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t"> Mark but those Hogs (Emblem 34)</span><span class="idx">99</span></a> praises the “chaste and constant turtledove” as a model for romantic relationships, contrasting the worldly hogs with the spiritual doves.</p>
