                <p>Poems that script the exchanges among “parliaments” of beasts, fowl, flowers, women or other unlikely politicians and speakers stretch back at least as far as Chaucer’s late fourteenth-century <span class="it">Parliament of Fowls</span>. In the 1650s and 1660s, following the English Civil Wars between king and Parliament, the term was newly topical. Pulter is not the only English writer in the period to give voice to contentious flowers.</p>
                <p>Pulter’s daughter Anne died in 1666, suggesting “The Garden” may have been started before that, since the title of the poem in the manuscript states that the poem was written at Anne’s request. In the manuscript, Anne’s name has also been crossed out. Although we cannot pin a precise date on the poem, we can place it in the context of roughly contemporary texts with similar designs. <span class="it">Antheologia or the Speech of Flowers</span> (in 1655) takes its conceit from the fact that the word anthology means a gathering of flowers; James Howell’s “the gathering, or parliament of flowers” appeared in 1661. In 1668, Abraham Cowley published books 3 and 4 of his neo-Latin epic <span class="it">Plantarum Libri Sex</span>, which includes a trial in which various flowers try to convince the goddess Flora to choose one queen as superior to the others. While it is certainly possible that Pulter read Cowley’s work in manuscript, it’s just as possible he read hers—which might add another layer of mischief to the fact that in his first few books he focuses on medicinal plants used by women, particularly abortifacients. Cowley claimed that no one in “the inspired tribe” of poets had undertaken a thorough discussion of plants because the topic was too vast and “they were unwilling to begin a work which they despaired of finishing.” He is able to undertake this, he asserts, because he considers himself “a pigmy in learning.” Cowley’s explanation for why no one else has done quite this offers a rationale for why a woman might do it first—and perhaps even why she might leave it unfinished. Perhaps Pulter enjoyed the freedoms of writing like no one’s reading. Cowley also describes poetry about plants as a method of distillation: “not to press out their liquor crude in a simple enumeration, but as it were in a limbec by the gentle heat of poetry to distill and extract their spirits.” This affirms Wendy Wall’s suggestion that we view a Pulter poem as a distillate, a kind of hydrosol (“Pulter and Making” [paper presented at Poet in the Making: A Symposium on Hester Pulter’s Poems and <span class="it">The Pulter Project</span>, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, July 2018]).</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>In the following discourse there is nothing presented but sweet flowers and herbs: I could wish it had been in the summertime, when the heat of the sun might have improved their fragrance to the greatest advantage and rendered them more acceptable to the smell of the reader, being now sadly sensible that autumn, the usher of winter, will abate of their sweetness, and present them much to their loss …</p>
                    <p>It is desired that this discourse may but find as much candidness as it brings, and be entertained according to his own innocency. I have heard a story of an envious man, who had no other way to be revenged of his neighbor, who abounded with store of beehives, than by poisoning all the flowers in his own garden, wherein his neighbors’ bees took their constant repast, which infection caused a general mortality in all the winged cattle of his neighbor. I hope none have so splenetic a design against this my harmless treatise, as to envenom my flowers with pestilent and unintended interpretations, as if any thing more than flowers were meant in the flowers, or as if they had so deep a root underground, that men must mine to understand some concealed and profound mystery therein. Surely, this mythology is a cabinet which needeth no key to unlock it; the lid or cover lieth open.</p>
                    <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
                    <p>There was a place in Thessaly (and I am sorry to say there <span class="it">was</span> a place in Thessaly, for though the place be there still, yet it is not itself. The bones thereof remain, not the flesh and color; the standards of hills and rivers, not the ornaments of woods, bowers, groves, and banqueting-houses. These long since are defaced by the Turks, whose barbarous natures wage war with civility itself, and take a delight to make a wilderness where before their conquest they found a Paradise). This place is some five miles in length, and though the breadth be coequal with the length, to equalize the same, and may so seem at the first sight, yet it falleth short upon exact examination, as extending but to four miles. This place was by the poets called Tempe, as the abridgment of earthly happiness, showing that in shorthand which the whole world presented in a larger character. No earthly pleasure was elsewhere afforded, but here it might be found in the height thereof. Within this circuit of ground there is still extant, by the rare preservation of the owner, a small scantling of some three acres, which I might call the Tempe of Tempe, and re-epitomized the delicacies of all the rest. It was divided into a garden, in the upper part whereof flowers did grow; in the lower, herbs, and those of all sorts and kinds. And now in springtime Earth did put on her new clothes, though had some cunning herald beheld the same, he would have condemned her coat to have been of no ancient bearing, it was so overcharged with variety of colors. For there was yellow marigold, wallflowers, auriculas, gold-knops,<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-1" id="fna-1-1">1</a> and abundance of other nameless flowers, which would pose<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-2" id="fna-1-2">2</a> a nomenclator<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-3" id="fna-1-3">3</a> to call them by their distinct denominations. There was white—the daisy, white roses, lilies, &amp;c.; blue—violet, iris; red—roses, peonies, &amp;c. The whole field was vert or green, and all colors were present save sable, as too sad and doleful for so merry a meeting; all the children of Flora being summoned there, to make their appearance at a great solemnity. Nor was the lower part of the ground less stored with herbs, and these so various, that if Gerard himself had been in the place, upon the beholding thereof he must have been forced to a re-edition of his <span class="it">Herbal</span>, to add the recruit of those plants, which formerly were unseen by him, or unknown unto him.</p>
                    <p>In this solemn rendezvous of flowers and herbs, the Rose stood forth, and made an oration to this effect: “It is not unknown to you, how I have the precedency of all flowers confirmed unto me, under the patent of a double sense: sight, smell. What, more curious colors ? How do all dyers blush when they behold my blushing, as conscious to themselves that their art cannot imitate that tint which Nature hath stamped upon me. Smell, it is not lusciously offensive, nor dangerously faint, but comforteth with a delight, and delighteth with the comfort thereof. Yea, when dead, I am more sovereign than living. What cordials are made of my syrups? How many corrupted lungs (those fans of nature), sore wasted with consumption, that they seem utterly unable any longer to cool the heat of the heart with their ventilation, are, with conserves made of my stamped leaves, restored to their former soundness again? More would I say in mine own cause, but that haply I may be taxed of pride and self-flattery, who speak much in mine own behalf, and therefore I leave the rest to the judgment of such as hear me, and pass from this discourse to my just complaint. There is lately a flower (Shall I call it so? In courtesy I will term it so, though it deserve not the appellation), a Tulip, which hath ingrafted the love and affections of most people into it. And what is this Tulip? A well-complexioned stink, an ill savor wrapped up in pleasant colors. As for the use thereof in physic, no physician hath honored it yet with the mention, nor with a Greek or Latin name, so inconsiderable hath it hitherto been accounted. And yet this is that which filleth all gardens, hundreds of pounds being given for the root thereof, whilst I, the Rose, am neglected and contemned, and conceived beneath the honor of noble hands, and fit only to grow in the gardens of yeomen. I trust the remainder to your apprehensions, to make out that which grief for such undeserved injuries will not suffer me to express.” Hereat the Rose wept, and the dropping of her white tears down her red cheeks so well became her, that if ever sorrow was lovely, it then appeared so, which moved the beholders to much compassion, her tears speaking more than her tongue in her own behalf.</p>
                    <p>The Tulip stood up insolently, as rather challenging, than craving respect, from the Commonwealth of Flowers there present, and thus vaunted itself. “I am not solicitous what to return to the complaint of this Rose, whose own demerit hath justly outed itself of that respect which the mistaken world formerly bestowed upon it, and which men’s eyes, now opened, justly reassume, and confer on those who better deserve the same. To say that I am not more worthy than the Rose, what is it but to condemn mankind, and to arraign the most gentle and knowing among men, of ignorance for misplacing their affections? Surely, vegetables must not presume to mount above rational creatures, or to think that men are not the most competent judges of the worth and value of flowers. I confess there is yet no known sovereign virtue in my leaves, but it is injurious to infer that I have none, because as yet not taken notice of. If we should examine all by their intrinsic value, how many contemptible things in Nature would take the upper hand of those which are most valued? By this argument a flint stone would be better than a diamond, as containing that spark of fire therein, whence men with combustible matter may heat themselves in the coldest season. And clear it is that the loadstone (that grand pilot to the North, which findeth the way there in the darkest night) is to be preferred before the most orient pearl in the world. But they will generally be condemned for unwise who prize things according to this proportion. Seeing therefore in stones and minerals, that those things are not most valued which have most virtue, but that men according to their eyes and fancies raise the reputation thereof, let it not be interpreted to my disadvantage that I am not eminently known for any cordial operation; perchance the discovery hereof is reserved for the next age, to find out the latent virtue which lurketh in me. And this I am confident of, that Nature would never have hung out so gorgeous a sign, if some guest of quality had not been lodged therein. Surely my leaves had never been feathered with such variety of colors (which hath proclaimed me the King of all Lilies) had not some strange virtue, whereof the world is yet ignorant, been treasured up therein. As for the Rose, let her thank herself if she be sensible of any decay in esteem. I have not ambitiously affected superiority above her, nor have I fraudulently endeavored to supplant her; only I should have been wanting to myself, had I refused those favors from ladies which their importunity hath pressed upon me. And may the Rose remember how she, out of causeless jealousy, maketh all hands to be her enemies that gather her. What need is there that she should garrison herself within her prickles? Why must she set so many thorns to lie constant <span class="it">perdue</span><a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-4" id="fna-1-4">4</a>, that none must gather her, but such as suddenly surprise her? And do not all that crop her run the hazard of hurting their fingers? This is that which hath weaned the world from her love, whilst my smooth stalk exposing ladies to no such perils, hath made them by exchange to fix their removed affections upon me.”</p>
                    <p>At this stood up the Violet, and all prepared themselves with respectful attention, honoring the Violet for the age thereof, for, the Primrose alone excepted, it is Seignior to all the flowers in the year, and was highly regarded for the reputation of the experience thereof, that durst encounter the cold, and had passed many bitter blasts, whereby it had gained much wisdom, and had procured a venerable respect, both to his person and counsel. “The case” (saith the Violet) “is not of particular concernment, but extendeth itself to the life and liberty of all the society of flowers. The complaint of the Rose, we must all acknowledge to be just and true, and ever since I could remember, we have paid the Rose a just tribute of fealty, as our prime and principal. As for this Tulip, it hath not been in being in our garden above these sixty years. Our fathers never knew that such a flower would be, and perhaps our children may never know it ever was. What traveler brought it hither, I know not; they say it is of a Syrian extraction, but sure there it grew wild in the open fields, and is not beheld otherwise than a gentler sort of weed. But we may observe that all foreign vices are made virtues in this country: foreign drunkenness is Grecian Mirth (thence the proverb, The Merry Greek); foreign pride, Grecian good behavior; foreign lust, Grecian love; foreign laziness, Grecian harmlessness; foreign weeds, Grecian flowers. My judgment therefore is, that if we do not speedily eradicate this intruder, this Tulip in process of time will out us all of our just possessions, seeing no flower can pretend a clearer title than the Rose hath. And let us every one make the case to be his own.”</p>
                    <p>The gravity of the Violet so prevailed with the Senate of Flowers, that all concurred with his judgment herein: and such who had not the faculty of the fluentness of their tongues to express themselves in large orations thought that the well managing of a yea, or nay, spoke them as well wishing to the general good as the expressing themselves in large harangues. And these soberly concluded that the Tulip should be rooted out of the garden, and cast on the dunghill, as one who had justly invaded a place not due thereunto; and this accordingly was performed.<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-5" id="fna-1-5">5</a></p>

They, seeking to preserve themselves for their remaining moments, and out of revenge against “the whole Corporation of Flowers, out of which they were ejected as useless and dangerous members,” direct the boar to a hole in the hedge protecting the garden, left by the gardener’s neglect, where he can enter and glut himself on flowers and herbs in their prime. He goes there and terrifies the plants. Sage ultimately redirects the boar to Hogweed in the kitchen garden, which he devours so greedily that he is too fat to get back out through the hole in the hedge and is butchered by the Gardener and his dogs.

                    <p>Upon a time, the flowers assembled, and met in one general council, by the authority and summons of the Sovereign Rose, their undoubted natural King, who had taken the Lily for his royal spouse. The dew of heaven fell plentifully upon this happy conjunction, which made them to burgeon, to propagate and prosper exceedingly, in so much that the sweet fragrant odor which they did cast diffused itself over all the earth. To this meeting came the Violet, Gillyflower, the Rosemary, the Tulip, Lavender and Thyme; the Cinquefoil (though of a foreign growth) had an honorable rank amongst them, and as some observed, got too much credit with the royal Rose. The flowers of the field were admitted also to this great council: the Cowslip, the Honeysuckle, and Daisy had their delegates there present, to consult of a reformation of certain abuses which had taken rooting in the Commonwealth of Flowers, and being all under the Rose, they had privilege to speak all things with freedom. Complaints were made that much Cockle and Darnel, with other noxious herbs and tares<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-2-1" id="fna-2-1">1</a> were crept in amongst them, that the Poppy did pullulate<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-2-2" id="fna-2-2">2</a> too much, with divers other grievances. The success of this Senate, this great bed or posy of living flowers, was like to prove very prosperous, but that the herbs Briony, Wormwood, Wolf’s-bane, Rue, and Melampode<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-2-3" id="fna-2-3">3</a> (the emblems of Sedition, Malice, Fear, Ambition and Jealousy) thrust in amongst them, and much distempered their proceedings. These brought in with them the Burr,<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-2-4" id="fna-2-4">4</a> which exceedingly retarded and entangled all businesses; and it was thought that the Thistle was, too, meddling amongst them, which made matters grow to that acrimony and confusion as if the herb Morsus Diaboli<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-2-5" id="fna-2-5">5</a> had got in amongst them. Amongst many other good-morrows, they propounded to the Rose, that he should part with his prickles, and transmit his strength that way to be disposed of by them; the Royall Rose liked not this bold request of theirs, though couched in very smooth language, but answered: “I have hitherto condescended to everything you have propounded, much more than any of my predecessors ever did; but touching these prickles, which God and nature hath given me, and are inherent in me and my stock from the beginning, though they be but excrescences, yet you know they fortify and arm me, <span class="it">Armat Spina Rosam</span>.<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-2-6" id="fna-2-6">6</a> And by them I protect you and your rights from violence, and what protection, I pray, can there be without strength? Therefore, I will by no means part with them to enfeeble my regal power, but will retain them still, and bequeath them to my posterity, which I would be loath to betray in this point. Nor do I much value what that silly infected animal, the King of Bees, tells me sometimes, when humming up and down my leaves; he would buzz this fond belief into me, how it added much to his majesty that nature gives him no sting, as all other bees have, because he should rely altogether upon the love and loyalty of his subjects. No. I will take warning by the Eagle, the King of Volatiles,<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-2-7" id="fna-2-7">7</a> and by the Lion, King of Quadrupedals, who (as the Prince of Moralists<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-2-8" id="fna-2-8">8</a> reports) when by fair insinuations the one had parted with his talons, the other with his teeth and ongles,<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-2-9" id="fna-2-9">9</a> wherein their might, and consequently their majesty consisted, grew afterwards contemptible to all creatures, and quite lost that natural allegiance and awe which was due unto the one from all birds, and to the other, from all beasts of field and forest.”</p>

                    <p>MORAL</p>
                    <p>Every natural born monarch hath an inherent inalienable strength in himself, which is the common militia of his kingdom; for, though the people’s love (which oftentimes is got by an Apple, and lost by a Pear) be a good citadel, yet there must be a concurrence of some visible settled force besides, which no earthly power may dispose of without his royal commands: and for him to transmit this strength to any other, is the only way to render him inglorious and despicable, both at home and abroad. And thus you have the spirit of these flowers, and moral of the fable.</p>

                <h3>Abraham Cowley, <span class="it">Plantarum Libri Sex</span></h3>
                <p>Cowley published six books on plants in Latin verse in 1668. Translations of all six books appeared as part of Cowley’s complete works in 1689. In his Author’s Preface to the first two books, which were published before the others (in 1662), he gives voice to many of the same flowers Pulter includes in her contention: the Violet, Auricula, Tulip, Flower De Luce, and Rose (in Book 3), and the White Lily, Poppy, Sunflower, and Gillyflower (in Book 4). These are all worth considering and all of the books are available in English translation online in <span class="it">The Abraham Cowley Text and Image Archive</span> at the University of Virginia. I have chosen to include here the frame, with the goddess Flora agreeing to preside over the trial and then rendering her judgment, and the speeches of the Tulip, Rose, and White Lily. Like Pulter’s narrator, Flora declines to render the judgment requested, offering a version of what Queen Elizabeth called an “answer answerless.”</p>

                    <p>Considering the incredible veneration which the best poets always had for gardens, fields, and woods, insomuch that in all other subjects they seemed to be banished from the Muse’s territories, I wondered what evil planet was so malicious to the breed of plants as to permit none of the inspired tribe to celebrate their beauty and admirable virtues. Certainly a copious field of matter, and what would yield them a plentiful return of fruit, where each particular, besides its pleasant history (the extent whereof everybody, or to speak more truly, nobody, can sufficiently understand), which contains the whole fabric of human frame, and a complete body of physic. From whence I am induced to believe, that those great men did not so much think them improper subjects of poetry, as discouraged by the greatness and almost inexplicable variety of the matter, and that they were unwilling to begin a work which they despaired of finishing. I, therefore, who am but a pygmy in learning, and scarce sufficient to express the virtues of the vile seaweed, attempt that work which those giants declined. Yet wherefore should I not attempt? Forasmuch as they disdained to take up with less than comprehending the whole, and I am proud of conquering some part. I shall think it reputation enough for me to have my name carved on the barks of some trees, or (what is reckoned a royal prerogative) inscribed upon a few flowers. You must not therefore expect to find so many herbs collected for this fardle,<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-3-1" id="fna-3-1">1</a> as sometimes go to the compounding of one single medicine. These two little books are therefore offered as small pills made up of sundry herbs, and gilt with a certain brightness of style; in the choice whereof I have not much labored, but took them as they came to hand, there being none amongst them which contained not plenty of juice, if it were drawn out according to art; none so insipid that would not afford matter for a whole book, if well extracted. The method which I judged most genuine and proper for this work, was not to press out their liquor crude in a simple enumeration, but as it were in a limbeck, by the gentle heat of poetry, to distill and extract their spirits. Nor have I chosen to put them together which had affinity in nature, that might create a disgust for want of variety; I rather connected those of the most different qualities, that their contrary colors, being mixed, might the better set off each other …</p>
