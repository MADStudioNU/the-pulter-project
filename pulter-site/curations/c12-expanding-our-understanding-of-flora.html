                <p>Pulter, like many other seventeenth-century writers, invokes Flora as the goddess of flowers. References to the goddess Flora might have helped to mystify the role of women in gardens, linking them to the flowers themselves more than to owning land or cultivating it: “Gardening books from the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries may have addressed and depicted the gentle female reader as the goddess Flora or her garden’s titular deity, but it was the male reader who was seen to manage that garden, whether for use or pleasure.” While women worked in gardens, “they became almost invisible as designers, propagators, and cultivators” (Rebecca Bushnell, <span class="it">Green Desire: Imagining Early English Gardens</span> [Cornell UP, 2003], p. 110; see also Jennifer Munroe, <span class="it">Gender and the Garden in Early Modern English Literature</span> [Ashgate, 2008]). Flora also has a more checkered past than one might expect. “According to her myth, Flora had been a notorious courtesan in the earliest days of Rome, who left so much of her immoral earnings to the city when she died that the grateful Romans deified her. She became both the goddess of flowers and the protector of prostitutes, and Dutch pamphleteers delighted in nothing more than drawing obvious parallels between the Roman whore and the valuable tulips that had passed from hand to hand so rapidly at the very height of the mania” (Mike Dash, <span class="it">Tulipomania</span> [New York: Three Rivers, 1999], p. 177). Here you will find some depictions of Flora and her ancient Roman backstory.</p>

                <h3>Flora in Cowley’s <span class="it">Of Plants</span></h3>
                
                <p>As you will see in Cowley’s depiction of a contention among flowers, included in the Curation for “The Garden” (Poem 12) on <ref target="#ctxs" type="pp-curations-ref">Parliaments of Flowers</ref>, Cowley has the goddess Flora preside over the trial of the flowers as their judge. First, he explains her history, describing her exile from Rome and fall from power. He does not, however, link her with having been a prostitute.</p>

In <span class="it">The Masque of Flowers</span>, included in the Curation <ref target="#ctxs" type="pp-curations-ref">Flower People</ref>, the Flower men’s costumes depend on embroidery and women are praised as “expressing” flowers through their embroidery.
