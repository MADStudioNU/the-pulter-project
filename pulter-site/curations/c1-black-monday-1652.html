    <h3>Observing the Eclipse</h3>
    <p>
      When the Moon’s shadow eclipsed the Sun’s light in August 2017, many North Americans had the opportunity to
      observe a total solar eclipse for the first time in nearly forty years. Extensive coverage in the media and on
      social media made this a highly anticipated event. Likewise, the total solar eclipse predicted for March 29, 1652
      was also highly anticipated. Dubbed “Black Monday,” this event was commemorated in astrological and astronomical
      treatises, almanacs, poems, and sermons.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to know whether Hester Pulter observed a lunar or solar eclipse; however, “The Eclipse” describes
      both astronomical events and also foregrounds the experience of observing. Gathered here are sources about “Black
      Monday” that suggest the broad range of contexts for the observation of eclipses during the seventeenth century.
    </p>
    <h3>The Eclipse as Portent</h3>
    <p>
      Eclipses were traditionally interpreted as political portents; they were often cited as heralds of leaders’
      downfalls or other calamities. “Black Monday” resulted in numerous publications demonstrating both credulous and
      skeptical responses to its portentous significance. The excerpts here include an astrologer’s predictions, a
      satirical ballad, and a sermon, which suggest a wide range of responses to “Black Monday.”
    </p>
    <p>
      William Lilly was one of the most famous astrologers during this period and he published several works that put
      forth prognostications based on Black Monday. In <span class="it">Annus Tenebrosus or the Dark Year</span>, he
      explains that the eclipse of March 1652 is the “greatest this Age hath beheld,” which means that readers “may
      expect accidents or effects to follow suitable to the greatnesse” (24). His book includes technical and scientific
      information about the prediction of eclipses and what observers can expect to see during the eclipse, but the
      work’s focus is political prediction based on astrology, or, in other words, precise location of the planets and
      other astronomical objects during the event. Some of these predictions are remarkably specific, such as the
      following description of its consequences for Parliament:

      <p>
        The time of the events signified by this Eclips, ending a little after that time which this present Parliament
        seems to have voted to give a period to their sitting; it is therefore very probably to be gathered from the
        effects of this Eclipse, that in good earnest the Souldier and People will join in one for calling a <span
        class="it">New Representative in this Commonwealth</span>: for the <span class="it">Moon</span>, who signifieth
        the People, eclipseth the <span class="it">Sun</span>; as if nothing would satisfie our earnest desires but that
        which perhaps it had been better for us to decline, it being more easier to repair an old house, then build a
        new.

      While astronomers had predicted a total solar eclipse for March 29, 1652, over most of England, only a partial
      solar eclipse was visible. As a result, publications after the event mocked astrologers who predicted dire events
      (and the people who believed them). The anonymous ballad <span class="it">Bugbear Black Monday</span> mocks the
      many Londoners who fled the city out of superstitious fear:

      Like Pulter, some observers used the eclipse as an opportunity for spiritual reflection. In a sermon preached at
      St. Paul’s on the Sunday before the eclipse (and published shortly after), Fulke Bellers creates an analogy
      between the shadow of the Moon that blocks the light of the Sun during a solar eclipse and the eclipsing effects
      of Sin on an individual believer’s relationship with Christ:

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        And so when the dense body of the Moon interposeth it self between us and the Sun, it causeth a <span
        class="it">Solar</span> eclipse. These are the natural causes of them. And so it is in regard of our spiritual
        eclipses, when as the condensed clouds of our sins ascend over our heads, and stand as the Moon between us and
        Christ, presently we come into an eclipse, in regard of our comfort.

    <h3>Almanacs and the Observation of Eclipses</h3>
    <p>
      One common source of astronomical information in the seventeenth century was the almanac, a yearly publication
      that gathered useful information about geography, weather, history, and culture in a single relatively inexpensive
      and accessible format. Almanacs were headed by calendar pages for each month. These pages had space for users to
      make notes and also usually included holidays, the phases of the moon, and other important events along with
      partial and total solar and lunar eclipses. The almanacs for 1652 make note of the occurrence of both a lunar and
      solar eclipse during the month of March, sometimes encouraging readers to observe the events. For instance, the
      calendar page for March of Vincent Wing’s 1652 almanac explains the eclipse in technical terms and reminds readers
      that they will not be able to observe the like again:
    </p>
    <div class="q">

        <div class="src">
          <span class="bt">Vincent Wing</span>, <span class="it">1652 Almanack</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        The Sun Eclipsed 12. Deg. The 29. Day at 10 before noon. Not a man now living ever saw the like before in
        England, nor shall hardly ever see the like again; therefore it will be worth your Observation.
      </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      Almanacs provided technical and practical information that could aid readers in gaining a scientific understanding
      of eclipses and allow them to observe a solar eclipse safely. Pond’s almanac for 1652 includes instructions for
      predicting eclipses and also the following advice, which would certainly be necessary in an age before the
      widespread availability of light-blocking eclipse glasses:
    </p>
    <div class="q">
      <div class="q-block">
        <div class="src">
          <span class="bt">Edward Pond</span>, <span class="it">1652 Almanack</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Take a burning-glass, such as men use to light tobacco within the sunne; or a spectacle-glasse that is thick in
        the middle, such as is for the eldest sight; and hold this glasse in the sunne as if you would burn through it a
        pastboard a or white paper book, or such like; and draw the glasse from the board or book, twice so farre as you
        do to burn with it: so by direct holding it nearer or further, as you shall see best, you may behold upon your
        board, the round body of the sun, and how the moon passeth between the glasse and the sun during the whole time
        of the eclipse.
      </p>
      <p>
        This mayest thou practise before the time of an eclipse, wherein thou shalt discern any cloud passing under the
        sunne: or by putting or holding a bullet or his fingers end betwixt the sun and the glasse at such time (The
        sunne shining) as though holdest the glasse as before thou are taught.
