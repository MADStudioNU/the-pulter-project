            <p>In the headnote to my Amplified Edition for <a href="/poems/115" title="Read “Phalaris and the Brazen Bull” (Emblem 50)" class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">Phalaris and the Brazen Bull</span><span class="idx">115</span></a>, I suggested that Pulter’s reference to Jamaica seems to originate from a Restoration context. In making this claim, I follow the work of Carla Gardina Pestana who has shown that accounts of royalists shipped off to Jamaica proliferated primarily after the Restoration, when “numerous men claimed to have been royalists driven into the force’s [New Model Army’s] ranks by a ruthless Cromwell” in order to signal their allegiance to the Stuart cause (<span class="it">The English Conquest of Jamaica: Oliver Cromwell’s Bid for Empire</span> [Cambridge, MA: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2017], 24). In the years following the civil wars, Cromwell had led England in an active imperial program, beginning with wars to conquer Ireland and Scotland, continuing with on-and-off contests against the Dutch, and culminating in the Western Design—Cromwell’s plan to balance Spanish power in the Caribbean. In December 1654, English vessels attempted to invade Hispaniola. England’s under-prepared forces were quickly rebuffed, and they redirected their efforts to Jamaica, where the Spanish presence was less pronounced. At the time, Jamaica was a backwater of the Spanish empire, known for bugs and diseases, and the English settlement there was very slow to develop (Ronald Hutton, <span class="it">The British Republic, 1649-1660</span> [New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1990], 109–11). Nevertheless, as Pestana argues, the English settlement there was a purposeful part of an imperial program that would directly inform later empire-building (<span class="it">English Conquest</span>, 12–15).</p>

            <p>At home in Hertfordshire, Pulter would have gotten only a small trickle of printed news concerning events in Jamaica before 1660. In October 1655, Cromwell issued a printed Proclamation encouraging people in England as well as in its other colonies to consider “transplant[ing] themselves to Jamaica” (<span class="it">By the Protector, A Proclamation Giving Encouragement to such as shall transplant themselves to Jamaica</span> [London, 1655]; and Daniel Gookin, <span class="it">To all Persons whom these may Concern, in the Several Townes, and Plantations of the United Colonies in New-England…who shall desire to remove themselves or families into Jamaica in the West-Indies</span> [Boston, 1656]). This proclamation was followed by fanciful news reports and natural histories, like <span class="it">A brief and perfect Journal Of The late Proceedings and Successe of the English Army in the West-Indies</span> (London, 1655); <span class="it">Hypocrisie Discovered: Or, A Further Manifestation of the secret Designe, Practices, and inventions of the Protector, so called, to seat himself in, and be vested with the Power and Office of chief Magistrate in this Nation</span> (London, 1655); <span class="it">Britains Triumphs, Or, A Brief History Of The Warres And Other State-Affairs Of Great Britain. From the Death of the late King, to the third year of the Government of the Lord Protector</span> (London, 1656); and <span class="it">A True Description Of Jamaica With the Fertility, Commodities, and Healthfulness of the place. As also The Towns, Havens, Creeks, Promontories, and the Circuit of the whole Island</span> (London, 1657). But after this initial flurry, the public discourse around the Western Design slowed.</p>

            <p>As for the sources of Pulter’s picture of parliamentarians (rather than royalists) forced to emigrate to the Caribbean, there are a few vague or unrealized references to people being sent to Jamaica in the print record from before 1660:</p>

            <p class="basic-quote"><span class="it">England</span> is now very populous, and the abundance of fruitlesse trees so encumber the vines, that they cannot fructifie; the late Civill war hath yet left some species of malignancy, the sores and corruptions of the Nation are not healed, because not cleansed, for the tincture of ungodliness is yet savoury in their palats; men of desperate fortunes have desperate means of remedy; they subsist not by sweat of their own brow, but reap the fruit of others labors, sowing the seed of sedition, and abominable wickedness in a Land where they have no right inheritance; Can a Christian Common-wealth flourish either in godliness, plenty, or peace, when it abounds with such profane vile caterpillers, and corrupters of all good manners? Is it not justice in God, and wisdome in man to expell such unworthy and unwelcome guests from among his people? <span class="it">Ireland</span> hath already a sufficient share, and <span class="it">Barbadoes</span>, (with the rest of those small Islands, subject to this Dominion, who were wont to be a receptacle for such vermin) are now so filled, that they vomit forth of their superfluities into other places. Could there be a lesse cruel, and more just means used then to imploy such in a Forain War? the Indies are spacious, pleasant and rich, too rich indeed for either the vicious inhabitants, or no lesse vicious invaders. But those whom England sent forth on this first expedition, were not many, their number was compleated elsewhere, and the design being advanced with much secresie (even to the Members of the Army it self) manifestly argueth what they were which were intended for that service; even such who willingly proceeded although they knew not whither. - From <span class="it">A brief and perfect Journal Of The late Proceedings and Successe of the English Army in the West-Indies</span> (London, 1655), 5–6.</p>
              
            <p class="basic-quote">Well, is this the News and certain, does it so startle you that it makes you look as if you were possessed with Essex, or a Kentish-Ague? It frights you as if you was served with a Warrant for <span class="it">Jamaica</span> or <span class="it">Hispaniola</span>.

            <p>Political prisoners may have, occasionally, been among the criminals and undesirable people sent to service beyond the seas, along with some 12,000 Irish people (Hutton, <span class="it">British Republic</span>, 48; Pestana, <span class="it">English Conquest</span>, 23–4; Peter Wilson Coldham, <span class="it">Emigrants in Chains: A Social History of Forced Emigration to the Americas of Felons, Destitute Children, Political and Religious Non-Conformists, Vagabonds, Beggars and Other Undesirables, 1607-1776</span> [Baltimore: Genealogical Pub. Co, 1992], 47–9). And there is no question that the sequestration and sale of royalist estates helped fund Cromwell’s Western Design (Hutton, <span class="it">British Republic</span>, 56; Pestana, <span class="it">English Conquest</span>, 17). But forcing disloyal men into service would have been a disastrous move, especially as the Protectorate struggled to maintain enthusiasm for an imperial plan that floundered as it shifted from Hispaniola to Jamaica, from the prospect of Spanish booty to the reality of disease and starvation (Pestana, <span class="it">English Conquest</span>, 24, 165–219).</p>

            <p>Not until after 1660 was Cromwell seen as the architect of such a policy, when he was charged, over and over, with sending “men by Thousands into plantations” and “remote Islands”:</p>

            <p>The restored Stuart monarchy, for its part, was happy to have negative attention directed at Cromwell and the regicides. As Pestana argues, it silently retained its hold on Jamaica and adopted the imperial policies established by Cromwell in his Western Design (English Conquest, 12–13, 252). Among these policies were new petitions and efforts to send prisoners and non-conformists to Jamaica (Coldham, Emigrants, 50–1; Pestana, English Conquest, 227), some of which were undertaken by Pulter’s nephew James Ley, third earl of Marlborough. In imagining the families of parliamentarians sent to Jamaica, Pulter may have been reversing printed accounts of royalist deportation. But she was also very likely responding to the family news she received about her nephew’s Caribbean ventures in the emerging English empire.</p>
