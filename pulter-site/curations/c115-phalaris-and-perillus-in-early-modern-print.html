                Of all the classical figures in Pulter’s poem, Phalaris appears most broadly in the archive of books
                printed 1450–1700. The story of the tyrant is repeated in the works of Cicero, Ovid, Seneca, Plutarch,
                Pliny, and Lucian. In Ovid’s rendering the story goes like this:

            <p>Of the ancient sources for the Phalaris story, we know for sure that Pulter had access to Pliny, whose
                Historie of the World is cited on several occasions in her manuscript, including in the margins of <a

            <p>From these ancient sources, Phalaris made his way into early modern writing, where his name appears in

            <p>Of these contemporary sources, we know for sure that Pulter was working from <span class="it">Orlando
                    Furioso</span> and <span class="it">The Anatomy of Melancholy</span> when writing <span
                    class="it">The Unfortunate Florinda</span> (Eardley, <span class="it">Poems</span>, 278).</p>

            <p>Most early modern references to Phalaris focus on his authoritarian rule, often listing him alongside such tyrants as Nero, Herod, Nimrod, Pharaoh, Caligula, and Dionysius, as a standard of evil against which to compare contemporary leaders. As such, Phalaris was, unsurprisingly, used by Protestants to criticize Roman Catholics for their violent behavior and especially Spanish Catholics, who not only tortured their victims but, unlike Phalaris, also silenced and censored them:</p>

But herein they should doe worse vnto vs, than Phalaris did vnto them, whom he stifled and choaked in his brasen bull; for hee did not hinder them from crying, but this rather, that he would not heare their cries, as the cries of men, lest he might haue pittie vpon them, but as the bellowings of bullockes and buls, the better to disguise the sound of mans voice.</p>

                <p>Notwithstanding, I may not with silence passe ouer a kind of cruelty, which I am perswaded <span class="it">Phalaris</span> himselfe would haue wondered at, viz. that they inflicted the last and greatest torment vpon them by fire (as <span class="it">Phalaris</span> did,) but first they cut out their tongues, bereauing them of the ease they might haue by speech, which <span class="it">Phalaris</span> permitted to those whom he tormented: and not so only, but hauing cut out their tongues, they gagged them, that so they might make no noise at all, but be as mute as fishes. Neither was it safe for any to say, they pitied them, or to make any shew or semblance thereof, much lesse to commend the constancy of those who had the meanes left them to manifest it in the middest of their torments.</p>

I am sorry to think, that whilst they Martyr others, they have too hot a bargain for themselves.</p>

            <p>But although Phalaris was called a butcher and the cruelest tyrant who ever lived, although he was deemed “all voyde of sparkes of loue” (<span class="it">A Poore Knight</span>, below) early modern writers also discovered a strange, rugged justice within his story: “Phalaris a tyrant of Sicilia punysshed men ofte rightfully, though he were hym self vnrightfull” (Ranulf Higden, below).  His “iudgement” was “Iust” and his “censure most impartiall” (Richard Brathwaite, below). For this reason, it was possible for Christian writers to integrate a Stoical reading of Phalaris in their calls for Christ-like patience and, like Pulter, for conscientious attention to the effects of guilt:

                <p>Conscience which is the invisible Iudge that sits upon the Tribunall of our Soules, sentencing our good and bad actions; shewing us what is to be done, what to be undone; a witnes either excusing or accusing us; a schoolemaster having in one hand a booke to instruct us, in the other a rod to to correct us: and like a Horsman having a bit to curbe us, that we may not run out, and a whipe to slash us when wee are unruly: which the <span class="it">Poets</span> expressed by the snakie haired <span class="it">Furies</span>, by the raven of <span class="it">Prometheus</span>, continually eating up his heart, and by the dart that sticks in the side of the wounded Deere.

            <p>These polemical discussions of Perillus’s flattery and guile opened spaces in the contemporary imagination for poets to figure and voice Phalaris and Perillus in love lyrics (Abraham Cowley), in satire (Andrew Marvell and Richard Brathwaite), in emblems (A Bloody Irish—though the author confuses Perillus and Phalaris), and in dialogues (A Poore Knight). Of these texts, Richard Braithwaite’s comes closest to Pulter’s in its use of the Phalaris story. Both poets use the image of the worm of conscience, the language of projects and projectors, and the discussion of Perillus’s bull as an engine.</p>

                    <li class="l"><span class="it">Perillus</span> an excellent Artificer (being then famous for excellent inuentions) to satisfie the inhumane disposition of the tyrant <span class="it">Phalaris</span>, as also in hope to be highly rewarded for his ingenious deuice: made a <span class="it">bull</span> of <span class="it">brasse</span> for a new kind of torment, presenting it to <span class="it">Phalaris</span>, who made, triall thereof by tormenting <span class="it">Perillus</span> first therein. From this Argument or subiect of <span class="it">reuenge</span>, we may obserue two speciall motiues of Morall instruction or humane Caution. The first is, to deterre vs from humoring or soothing such, on whom we haue dependence, in irregular or sinister respects. For the vertuous, whose <span class="it">comfort is the testimonie of a good conscience</span>, scorne to hold correspondence with vicious men, whose commands euer tend to depraued and enormious ends. The second is, a notable example of reuenge in <span class="it">Perillus</span> suffering, & in <span class="it">Phalaris</span> inflicting. Much was it that this curious Artizan expected, but with equall & deserued censure was he rewarded: for inglorious seconded by like ends. Hence the Satyre displayeth such in their natiue colours, who rather then they will lose the least esteeme with men of high ranke or qualitie, vse to dispence with faith, friend, and all, to plant them firmer in the affection of their Patron. But obserue the conclusion, as their meanes were indirect, so their ends sorted euer with the meanes. They seldome extend their temporizing houres to an accomplished age, but haue their hopes euer blasted, ere they be well bloomed: their iniurious aimes discouered, ere they be rightly leuelled: and their wishes to a tragicall period exposed, as their desires were to all goodnesse opposed. May all proiectors or stateforragers sustaine like censure, hauing their natures so reluctant or opposite to all correspondence with honour. Longer I will not dilate on this subiect, but recollect my spirits, to adde more spirit to my ouer-tyred <span class="it">Satyre</span>, who hath bene so long employed in the <span class="it">Embassie of Nature</span>, and wearied in dancing the <span class="it">Wilde mans measure</span>, that after <span class="it">Perillus</span> censure she must repose ere she proceede any further; and take some breath ere I dance any longer.</li>

            <p>There was also considerable confusion in the period over the authorship of a set of epistles that were attributed to Phalaris but did not seem to match his disposition. These had been translated from Greek to Latin by Italian humanists and were published by English stationers first in Latin (1485) and later in English (1634). These publications yielded perplexed responses from those who knew the story of the tyrant. William Painter, for instance, describes the cruelty of Phalaris and allows that “although this Tyrant farre excelled in beastlie crueltie, yet there appered some sparke of humanitie in him, by his mercie extended vpon <span class="it">Chariton</span> and <span class="it">Menalippus</span>, the twoo true louers before remembred,” before remarking, “the same <span class="it">Phalaris</span> wrote many proper and shorte Epistles, full of vertuous instructions, and holsome admonicions” (The <span class="it">Palace of Pleasure</span> [London, 1566], 26–7). Similarly, the English translator of the letters prefaced his edition: “This little Volume falling into my hands, and finding therein so much ancient courage, liberalitie, and magnificence; and <span class="it">Phalaris</span> represented in another shape, than that, which is given by such Historians as have written of him; who (either swayed with the universall hatred, wherwith all men (almost) in those times were possessed against such as subdued a popular Government under the command of one man) painted him for one of the most cruell and bloudie Tyrants of the world” (<span class="it">The Epistles of Phalaris, The Tyrant of Agrigentum in Sicily</span> [London, 1634], A3r–A3v). The confusion was not cleared until Richard Bentley, William Wotton, Charles Boyle, William Temple, and Jonathan Swift took up the subject in the later seventeenth century.</p>

            <p>One final context for Phalaris’s name in the print record is rather interesting given Pulter’s familiarity with botany. It seems quite likely that she would have known, from the many herbals in which it appears, that Phalaris is the name of a grass as well as a tyrant. The millet-like grass, which shook or “quaked” in the wind, made its way from Italy, Spain, France, and the Canary Islands to the gardens of England, where it was studied by botanists, used as seed for songbirds and hens, and combined with water to make a “good remedy against the ache of ye blader” (Turner, <span class="it">First and Seconde</span>, 85). Though none of the herbals suggests a Caribbean planting of the grass, its use for making bread and its adaptability to climates without frosts leave open the possibility that Pulter could have associated the plant and thus the tyrant with the Jamaica enterprises carried out, in part, by her nephew James Ley, third earl of Marlborough. At the beginning of the Restoration, one of these enterprises involved an attempt to ship some seventy-two Quakers to Jamaica (Pestana, <span class="it">English Conquest</span>, 227). It is suggestive, given the final punishment imagined in Pulter’s poem, that Phalaris grasses are described as “Quakers” and “Shakers” in many of the herbals and related books that mention them:</p>
