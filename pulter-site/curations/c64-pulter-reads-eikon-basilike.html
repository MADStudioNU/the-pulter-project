    <p>A copy of the widely circulated <span class="it">Eikon Basilike</span> (Eikōn basilikē) would have found its way into Pulter’s book collection. She was acquainted with the printer of the King’s book, William Dugard. As a royalist, who lamented the deaths of Lucas and Lisle, Pulter felt obliged and honored to contribute to the commemorative, often emblematic, literature on the tragically martyred king, who trades a crown of thorns for a heavenly crown in the frontispiece and emblem of <span class="it">Eikon Basilike</span>. The tribute and glorification of Charles I is a key theme in “And Must the Sword this Controverse Decide” (Poem 64).</p>
