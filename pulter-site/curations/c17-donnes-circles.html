      John Donne often used images of circles and circularity, for both erotic and devotional poems. In “A Valediction Forbidding Mourning,” the compasses represent the movement of lovers, while in the two sermons excerpted below circles represent the cycle of life.

        Take a flat Map, a Globe <span class="it">in plano</span>, and here is East, and there is West, as far asunder
        as two points can be put: but reduce this flat Map to roundnesse, which is the true form, and then East and West
        touch one another, and are all one: So consider mans life aright, to be a Circle, <span class="it">Pulvis es, & in pulverem reverteris, Dust thou art, and to dust thou must return; Nudus egressus, Nudus revertar, Naked I came, and naked I must go;</span>
        In this, the circle, the two points meet, the womb and the grave are but one point, they make but one station,
        there is but a step from that to this. This brought in that custome amongst the Greek Emperours, that ever at
        the day of their Coronation, they were presented with severall sorts of Marble, that they might then bespeak
        their Tombe. And this brought in that Custome into the Primitive Church, that they called the Martyrs dayes,
        wherein they suffered, <span class="it">Natalitia Martyrum</span>, their birth dayes; birth, and death is all
        one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their death was a birth to them into another life, into the glory of God; It ended one Circle, and created
        another; for immortality, and eternity is a Circle too; not a Circle where two points meet, but a Circle made at
        once; This life is a Circle, made with a Compasse, that passes from point to point; That life is a Circle
        stamped with a print, an endlesse, and perfect Circle, as soone as it begins. Of this Circle, the Mathematician
        is our great and good God; The other Circle we make up our selves; we bring the Cradle, and Grave together by a
        course of nature …

          So these Epistles are Catholick, so they are Canonical, and they are Circular so. But yet, though in a Circle
          we know not where the compass began, we know not which was the first point; yet we know, that the last point
          of the Circle returns to the first, and so becomes all one; and as much as we know the last, we know the first
          point. Since then the last point of that Circle, in which God hath created us to move, is a kingdome (for it
          is a kingdom of heaven) and it is a Court (for it is that glorious Court, which is the presence of God, in the
          communion of his Saints) it is a fair and a pious conception, for this Congregation, here present now in this
          place, to believe, that the first point of this Circle of our Apostle here, is a Court too …
