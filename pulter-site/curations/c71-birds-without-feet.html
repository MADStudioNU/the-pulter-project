    <p>In this poem, Pulter develops a spiritual meditation based upon an emblematic interpretation of an animal that she had certainly never seen. The manucodiat, now known as a bird-of-paradise, is a tropical bird that first became known to European explorers and naturalists during the sixteenth century. Compare Pulter’s treatment to two naturalists’ accounts, a seventeenth-century illustration of the “birds without feet” and one earlier poetic description.</p>
    <p>Du Bartas, <span class="it">Divine Weeks and Works</span> (translation Josuah Sylvester) was one of the most widely read poems of the seventeenth century. Often described as a hexameral epic, the <span class="it">Divine Weeks and Works</span> is an extended commentary on Genesis. The first book (or Week) follows Genesis 1:1-8 closely and describes Creation through depictions of all parts of the natural world. <span class="it">Divine Weeks and Works</span> could be (and was) used as a compendium of natural historical knowledge. The birds-of-paradise are described on the the fifth day of the first week among the “strange and admirable birds”:</p>

      <p>That Birds of Paradise want feet is not only a popular persuasion, but a thing not long since believed by learned men and great Naturalists, and among the rest by <span class="it">Aldrovandus</span> himself, deceived by the birds dried or in their cases, brought over into Europe of the <span class="it">East Indies</span>, dismembered, and bereaved of their Feet. Yea, <span class="it">Aldrovandus</span> and others do not stick to charge <span class="it">Antonius Pigaseta</span>, (who gave the first notice of this Bird to the <span class="it">Europeans</span>) with falsehood and lying, because he delivered the contrary. This error once admitted, the other fictions of idle brains, which seemed thence to follow, did without difficulty obtain belief, <span class="it">viz</span>. that they lived upon coelestial dew; that they flew perpetually without any intermission, and took no rest but on high in the Air, their Wings being spread; that they were never taken alive, but only when they fell down dead upon the ground: That there is in the back of the Male a certain cavity, in which the Female, whose belly is also hollow, lays her Eggs, and so by the help of both cavities they are sitten upon and hatched.  All which things are now sufficiently refuted, and proved to be false and fabulous, both by eye-witnesses, and by the birds themselves brought over entire.</p>

      <p>. . . .</p>

      <p>These most beautiful birds (as <span class="it">Aldrovandus</span> reports) are called by the inhabitants of the <span class="it">Molucca</span> Islands <span class="it">Manucodiatae</span>, that is, <span class="it">Gods birds</span>, and had in great esteem and veneration. They are called <span class="it">Birds of Paradise</span>, both for the excellent shape and beauty of their bodies, and also because where they are bred, whence they come, and whither they betake themselves is altogether unknown, sith they are found only dead upon the earth, so that the Vulgar imagine them to drop out of Heaven or Paradise.</p>
