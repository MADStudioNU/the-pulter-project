    <p>Pulter likely owned a copy of George Sandys’s <span class="it">A Paraphrase Upon the Divine Poems</span>, which features, as its first main biblical book, the Book of Job. Like “And Must the Sword this Controverse Decide” (Poem 64), the Book of Job prophesies that truth and equity will resolve the controversy, that is, the disputes or wars, which are being waged by the sword.</p>
