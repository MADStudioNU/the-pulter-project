  Circles featured symbolically in alchemy, for both the processes and the vessels involved.

    <span class="it">Circle</span>: the symbol of perfection. The circle signifies the perfect, eternal spiritual realm in contrast to the square, which signifies the earth, the corruptible world of illusion, the four elements, the four arms of the earthly cross. The circle with the dot in the centre symbolizes, at the macrocosmic level, gold. The completed opus alchymicum is also symbolized by the circle.

This is the ancient symbol of eternity, the perfection of art and of the completion of the alchemical opus (the <span class="it">opus circulatorium</span>). Superficially, it is a positive image of unity. It represents life as an ongoing cycle of birth and death, and the alchemical opus as a continuing series of acts of creation and recreation, progress and refinement. In alchemical texts, the <span class="it">ouroboros</span> is mapped on to two other spaces, the womb and the alembic (the vessel or retort, within which alchemical processes take place).
