      Today, the word “cetacean” refers specifically to a whale, dolphin, or porpoise, but it is derived from the Latin <span class="it">cetus</span>, a broader term including many large and legendary marine creatures. Similarly, while Pulter’s description of the “leviathan” (lines 77-84) seems to describe a whale, it participates in a long tradition of conflating whales with mythological sea monsters.
    </p>
    <p>
      One notable example of this tradition occurs in Conrad Gessner’s <span class="it">Historia animalium</span> (of which Topsell’s <span class="it">The History of Four-footed Beasts</span> was an abridged translation), published in Zürich during the 1550s and 1580s. Gessner’s description of the trolual, a tusked “devil whale” from Old Norse myth, also reflects the legend of the aspidochelone, a large sea creature bearing an unfortunate resemblance to an island. In most versions of this legend, unwitting sailors cast anchor into a sleeping whale that they mistake for dry land. However, when they disembark upon it and build a fire, the whale awakens and dives into the sea, taking the hapless sailors with it. Variants of this legend appear in the third-century Greek <span class="it">Alexander Romance</span>, the Old English poetry of the Exeter Book, <span class="it">The Wonders of Creation</span> by the thirteenth-century Persian scientist Zakariya al-Qazwini (who identifies the monster as a sea turtle), and medieval European hagiographies of St. Brendan the Navigator.

    Many early modern writers used whales and sea monsters as metaphors for powerful individuals or institutions, most famously Hobbes in his influential work of political philosophy, <span class="it">Leviathan</span> (1651). John Donne also included a whale in “Metempsychosis,” a poem that draws on Pythagoras’s doctrine of the transmigration of the soul. (On the related concept of palingenesis, see Frances E. Dolan’s <a href="https://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/poems/ee/view-but-this-tulip-emblem-40/#palingenesis">Curation</a> for Pulter’s <a href="/poems/105" title="Read “View But This Tulip (Emblem 40)” class="pp-poem-ref" target="_blank"><span class="t">View But This Tulip</span><span class="idx">105</span></a>.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Like “Universal Dissolution,” Donne's “Metempsychosis” relates the ascent of a soul from the humble bodies of plants to successively higher orders of beings, although Donne concludes with humans rather than celestial bodies. Donne describes the whale in an extended passage that may refer to the fall of Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex.

    The ocean’s perils could take many forms, and even small fish could prove dangerous for mariners. Many writers before Pulter warned of the remora or echeneis, which allegedly fastened itself to boats, thus impeding or halting their movement. Pliny the Elder went so far as to attribute Mark Antony’s failure at the Battle of Actium, and thus the end of the Roman Republic, to the echeneis:

      Certes, reported it is that in the naval battle before Actium, wherein Antonius and Cleopatra the queen were defeated by Augustus, one of these fishes stayed the admiral ship wherein M. Antonius was, at what time he made all the haste and means he could devise with help of oars, to encourage his people from ship to ship, and could not prevail, until he was forced to abandon the said admiral and go into another galley. Meanwhile the armada of Augustus Caesar, seeing this disorder, charged with greater violence, and soon invested the fleet of Antonie.

    Remoras appear in many early modern texts, including this illustration from Andrea Alciato's <span class="it">Emblemata</span>, a compilation of Latin verses and accompanying woodcuts first published in 1531. Alciato’s collection was the first European “emblem book,” a genre that had become popular by Hester Pulter’s lifetime.

    While it is true that remoras readily attach themselves to boats, marine animals, and even nearby humans, using their membranous dorsal fins to generate suction, ecologists now believe that in most cases, remoras do not significantly impair their hosts’ navigational abilities. Instead, the remora’s relationship to its host may be an example of commensalism (a symbiotic relationship in which one individual benefits and the other is not harmed) or mutualism (symbiosis benefitting both parties), as the remora may clean parasites and dead skin cells off its host’s body. Common remora hosts include sharks, whales, rays, and sea turtles.
