                    Pulter chooses not to identify the name of the man she calls “one of Ham’s cursed race,” but the source of the story is the Book of Jeremiah 38:6-13, and there he is called Ebed-Melech. He is an Ethiopian eunuch who serves King Zedekiah at the Jerusalem court where the prophet Jeremiah had been imprisoned. When Jeremiah’s prophecies about the fall of Jerusalem offend the city’s princes, they cast him into an underground cell without food or water. Recognizing that Jeremiah would likely die there, Ebed-Melech went to the king and revealed what the princes had done. Ebed-Melech was instructed to bring Jeremiah out of the pit, thereby saving the prophet from a slow, cruel death.
