    <p>
      Arthur Capel, first Baron Capel of Hadham, one of the wealthiest men in England, lived in Hadham Hall, only a few miles from Broadfield, home of his cousin Arthur Pulter. Hester Pulter is thus likely to have met him, even though her verse tribute to him gives no sign of personal knowledge. Capel was an interesting figure who deserves a full biography<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-1" id="fna-1-1">1</a>, yet today he is mainly known from a portrait by Cornelius Johnson of him, his wife, Elizabeth Morrison (1609/10–1661), and their children. In the 1630s Capel maintained some distance from the king’s religious and political directions, and it is perhaps indicative that he chose an artist of Dutch origins and of strong Reformed views, while the portrait highlighted his country estate. Johnson was nonetheless closely imitating a portrait of the king and his children by the latest fashionable court artist, Anthony van Dyck.<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-2" id="fna-1-2">2</a> Capel’s aristocratic status was recent and based on extensive landed wealth, partly gained through his marriage.

    </div>

    <p>At the beginning of the political crisis, Capel aligned himself with critics of the king and
      was the first MP to present to Parliament one of the petitions which Pulter so deplored. But he
      quickly came to believe that firm action was needed to defend church and crown against new
      dangers, and fought for the king in the first Civil War. Though an effective soldier, he also
      sought to use persuasion: after the king’s imprisonment by the army, he proposed a delegation
      from a group of prelates to warn Parliament of its un-Christian conduct. He took up arms in the
      second Civil War, and from then on his life was a series of cliff-hanging reversals. The army
      seized his sixteen-year-old son as a hostage until Elizabeth Capel gained his release. He
      fought and was captured at Colchester with Lucas and Lisle, who were shot on the orders of Sir
      Thomas Fairfax under strong pressure from Henry Ireton and the army. Capel escaped their fate
      because he and two other peers, Lord Norwich and Lord Hastings, were to be tried by Parliament.
      The treatment of royalist uprisers became a highly divisive issue. One MP longed “to see the
      day when we may hang the greatest Lord of them all, if he deserves it, without trial by his
      peers; and I doubt not but we shall have honest resolute judges to do it, notwithstanding Magna
      Charta.”<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-3" id="fna-1-3">3</a> Bu Capel had
      allies in Parliament, and on 18 November, at a time when the Presbyterian faction in Parliament
      had enough influence to offer concessions to the king, Capel and other royalist ringleaders
      including Lord Hastings were given the mild sentence of banishment, and Hastings fled. After
      Thomas Pride’s purge of the Presbyterian MPs on 6 December, the ascendent Independents wavered
      over whether the king or the others should be tried first. In the end the Commons, bypassing
      the Lords, which it would soon abolish, set up a High Court of Justice to try the king,
      deferring the treatment of the other royalists. Capel, imprisoned in the Tower of London, wrote
      appeals, based on constitutional and religious arguments, to a leading peer and to a
      Parliamentarian – possibly Cromwell – to circumvent the trial of the king. These failing, he
      attempted a bold escape by wading through the moat, but was then betrayed and recaptured. The
      king’s trial was followed by a new High Court of Justice to try five royalists including Capel
      and Norwich. This was, Kingston writes, “an incident in the drama, which, next to the execution
      of the King, created a greater amount of interest than any event since the termination of the
      War” (p. 108). Capel’s spirited defense of himself at his trial on constitutional grounds
      aroused the admiration of the Leveller John Lilburne, who had turned against the republic as a
      new tyranny. Capel and Norwich were both sentenced to death, but in another last-minute
      reversal Norwich was pardoned; Capel, however, was not reprieved, despite a petition from his
      wife, to whom he wrote an eloquent final letter. That letter expounds a “patriarchal” political
      ideology: king as head of state and father as head of household are divinely ordained and
      mutually supportive. Urging his wife to follow his advice, Capel quotes the fifth commandment,
      “Honour your father and your mother,” as the basis of his support for the king. Capel was
      beheaded on 9 March 1649 along with two other royalist peers. He gave a brave and defiant
      speech on the scaffold, praising Prince Charles and the royal children and wishing that they
      might all be kings. His heart was placed in a silver box, to be buried with the king.</p>

    <p>The twists and turns of Capel’s fate thus exemplified the accelerating pace of revolution,
      and many tributes to him quickly appeared in print, taking advantage of some temporary
      loopholes in the censorship system.<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-1-4"

      the young Lord Hastings (who may have been present at Colchester, as his uncle Henry Lord

      have been as brave as Capel. Nedham’s elegy was preceded by one by Andrew Marvell, who had
      published an angry elegy for the Duke of Buckingham, another prominent royalist victim of the
      second civil war (<span class="it">Lachrymae Musarum</span>, London, 1649, sigs. F1v-5r). Capel

    <p>The following documents provide contexts for the Capel poem. The first group consists of
      letters and documents published posthumously, some of which could have been known to his circle
      at the time. His appeal to an army leader, probably Cromwell, shows his acute awareness of the
      dangers of a military dictatorship, on which point Levellers came to agree with him. The
      letters also show his close bond with his wife. These are followed by some contemporary
      tributes, and a different perspective on the trial of Capel and others by the republican Lucy
      Hutchinson.</p>

      <p>Is it not now high time then to stop and make a halt? Is there not enough done to satiate
        the <span class="it">vanity</span>, and quench the <span class="it">thirst</span> after
        military <span class="it">renown</span>, when you have vanquished your <span
          class="it">Compatriots</span> and <span class="it">fellow Citizens</span>, and under such a
        <span class="it">Prince</span>: Look upon the brink of what a dreadful precipice you are; and
        let this last, and those other considerations be <span class="it">seriously</span> revolv’d by
        you: To which being added those weights, which your own judgment can cast into the <span
          class="it">scales</span>, undoubtedly you will see that there is a <span class="it">wide</span>
        distance between making a conquest over a people, (of which their own differences will lay
        claim to the greatest share,) and governing them contrary to their own <span
          class="it">appetites</span> by so small a part of themselves; and that means are <span
          class="it">easilier</span> found and <span class="it">readier</span> at hand to <span
          class="it">desolate</span> and <span class="it">disorder States</span>, than such as shall
        <span class="it">compose</span> and <span class="it">rule</span> them, various to long
        ingrafted customs, and their own inclinations…Methinks you cannot well avoid the observation
        that the most <span class="it">perspicacious</span> and <span class="it">sagacious persons</span> of your party,
        who with a wonderful <span class="it">stedfastness</span> and <span
          class="it">undismayedness</span> have kept company with you in your <span class="it">counsels
and affairs</span>, and in the greatest hazards (for you have not alwaies been without such,)
        do herein, and in this action, and in this highest time of your <span class="it">power</span>
        and <span class="it">prosperity</span>, not only make a stop, but avowedly withdraw themselves,
        and declare <span class="it">against</span> it, no doubt but very evidently foreseeing the
        <span class="it">fatality</span> of such an <span class="it">enormous</span> and <span
          class="it">unparalell’d attempt</span>…</p>

      <p>Upon the prospect of these foregoing considerations, (and there want not others important)
        draw a short state of the whole affair; and it will be thus, or little otherwise. At the
        present, <span class="it">you of the Army</span> stand <span class="it">high</span>, but <span

        you, <span class="it">small; they are</span>, to speak of, <span class="it">all in one cluster,
the Army; and that not all ripe for such designs</span>: through the Kingdom they are so <span
          class="it">thinly disseminated</span>, that the appearance of them by the eye is scarcely <span
          class="it">discernable</span>; and lastly, to deal frankly with you, (because their temper in
        your affair, will make a notable impression,) for <span class="it">the greater number a
vertiginous and giddy generation, that will never suffer quiet to themselves, you, nor others</span>.</p>

    <p>The following letters offer final injunctions to Capel’s wife. The first urges her to
      conform to models of female obedience, and to avoid what many men claimed to be a female
      tendency to allow passion to overrule reason. These ideals are grounded in religion, under
      which obedience to the king is subsumed, as obedience to the Fifth Commandment, “Honor thy
      father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth
      thee.” In the second letter, Capel declares that God will take his place as a father, another
      reason for her not to grieve excessively. The king as father is not found in Pulter’s poems on
      the regicide.</p>

    <p>This letter, from George Morley, later Bishop of Winchester, to Capel’s chaplain Edward

      his wife that his composition is disrupted. His paternal advice to his son is for honesty

          he could not chuse but confess a little of <span class="it">Humane Frailty</span>; yet even
          then he did not forget both to <span class="it">comfort</span> and <span class="it">counsel</span> her, and
          the rest of his Friends; particularly, in blessing the <span class="it">young
Lord</span>, he commanded him never to <span class="it">revenge</span> his Death, though it
          should be in his Power: The like he said unto his <span class="it">Lady</span>. He told his
          <span class="it">Son</span>, He would leave him a <span class="it">Legacy</span> out of <span
            class="it">David’s Psalms</span>, and that was this; <span class="it">Lord, lead me in a plain
Path</span>. For, Boy, (said he) I would have you a <span class="it">plain honest</span> Man,
          and hate <span class="it">Dissimulation</span>.</p>

        <p>After this, with much adoe I perswaded his <span class="it">Wife</span>, and the rest to be
          gone: and then being all alone with me, he said, <span class="it">Doctor, the hardest part of
my Work in this World, is now past</span>; meaning the <span class="it">parting</span> with his
          <span class="it">Wife</span>.</p>

      <p>In his last speech on the scaffold, Capel insists that his theological position is in the
        mainstream of English Protestantism. Many Puritans believed that the Church of England,
        especially under Charles I, had become compromised by idolatry, its love of ritual being combined
        with an ‘Arminian’ theology of free will which implied that salvation came through formal
        religious observance rather than faith alone. To some, this seemed merely a way-station towards a
        return to the Catholic church. Capel defends church and king by proclaiming that far from being a
        Catholic, he believes with most Puritans that good works have nothing to do with salvation, but
        that such a belief is quite compatible with the the Thirty-Nine Articles, the confessional
        statement of the recently-abolished Church. Again he takes the Fifth Commandment as the basis of
        his political beliefs, and ends with a tribute to Charles I and to his son. The idea that
        Charles II might “exceed” his father’s virtues seems to imply some reservations behind Capel’s
        loyalty. As he had done in the letter to his wife, he counsels against violence and revenge. This
        narrative concludes with one of several different accounts of his behavior on the scaffold; here
        it is not the king but his wife who has his last words.</p>

        <p>But it is necessary I should tell you somewhat more, That I am a <span class="it">Protestant</span>: And
          truly, I am a <span class="it">Protestant</span>, and very much in love with the Profession of it, after the
          manner as it was established in <span class="it">England</span>, by the thirty nine Articles. A
          blessed way of Profession; and such an one as truly, I never knew none so good. I am so far from
          being a <span class="it">Papist</span>, which some Body have (truly) very unworthily at some time
          charged me withal, that truly, I profess to you, that though I love Good Works, and commend Good
          Works; yet I hold they have nothing at all to do in the matter of Salvation. My Anchor-hold is
          this; <span class="it">That Christ loved me, and gave Himself for me</span>: That is that that I
          rest upon. . . . But truly, that that is stranger, you that are <span class="it">English-men</span> behold
          here an <span class="it">English-man</span> here before you, and acknowledged a
          Peer, not condemned to die by any Law of <span class="it">England</span>, not by any Law of <span
            class="it">England</span>: nay, shall I tell you more? (which is strangest of all) contrary to
          all the Laws of <span class="it">England</span>, that I know of. And truly, I will tell you, in
          the matter of the Civil Part of my Death, and the Cause that I have maintained, I die (I take it)
          for maintaining the <span class="it">Fifth Commandment</span>, enjoyned by <span class="it">God</span>
          himself, which enjoyns Reverence and Obedience to Parents: All Divines on all Hands, though
          they contradict one another in many several Opinions; yet all Divines, on all Hands, do
          acknowledge, that here is intended Magistracy and Order: And certainly, I have obeyed that
          Magistracy, and that Order, under which I have lived, which I was bound to obey. And truly, I do
          say very confidently, That I do die here for keeping, for obeying that <span class="it">Fifth
Commandment</span> given by <span class="it">God</span> himself, and written with his own Finger.
        </p>

        <p>And now, Gentlemen, we have had an Occasion by this Intimation, to remember His Majesty, our
          King that last was; and <span class="it">I</span> cannot speak of Him, nor think of it, but truly
          <span class="it">I</span> must needs say, That in my Opinion, that have had time to consider all
          the Images of all the greatest and vertuousest Princes in the World; and truly, in my Opinion,
          there was not a more vertuous, and more sufficient Prince known in the World, than our gracious
          King <span class="it">Charles</span> that died last. <span class="it">God</span> Almighty
          preserve our <span class="it">King</span>, that now is, his Son; <span class="it">God</span> send
          him more Fortunate, and longer days: <span class="it">God</span> Almighty so assist him, that he
          may exceed both the Vertues and Sufficiences of his Father…</p>

        <p><span class="it">Capel</span>.</p>

        <p><span class="it">Stay a little; which side do you stand upon?</span>(speaking to the
          Executioner) <span class="it">Stay, I think, I should lay my Hands forward that way,</span>
          (pointing fore-right;) and Answer being made, <span class="it">Yes</span>; he stood still a
          little while, and then said; God <span class="it">Almighty bless all this People</span>; God
          <span class="it">Almighty stench [staunch] this Blood</span>; God <span class="it">Almighty
stench, stench, stench this Issue of Blood: This will not do the business</span>; God <span
            class="it">Almighty find out another way to do it</span>. And then turning to one of his
          Servants, said; Baldwin, <span class="it">I cannot see any thing that belongs to my Wife; but I
must desire thee, and beseech her to rest wholly upon</span> Jesus Christ; <span class="it">to be
contented, and fully satisfied.</span></p>

        Cromwell and Ireton pulling the strings, and ended with the dead bodies of those killed at

      <p>The execution of Charles I and the attendant constitutional revolution, the establishment of a
        republic and the abolition of the House of Lords, outraged not only conservatives but also the
        Levellers who had called for constitutional reforms but wished them to be grounded in legal
        precedent. Thus John Lilburne can be found cheering on Lord Capel as he spoke at his trial in what
        was clearly a rigged court.</p>

      <p>…at my coming to town Duke Hamilton, and the stout Lord <span class="it">Capel</span> &c. had
        newly entred upon the stage for the tryal of their lives, and I confess, I was exceeding curious,
        in satisfiing my self about the manner of dealing with them, and so up into the court I got and
        heard the begining of their defence, and afterwards went and spoke with them, looking upon them
        as part of the people of England, unto whom if any injustice was done, it became a president to
        destroy me, or the most righteous man in England…, when I came to hear stout <span
          class="it">CAPEL</span> make his defence for himself, (which was before he had any counsel
        assigned) <span class="it">and so</span> GALLANTLY <span class="it">and acutely to plead the Law,
and demand the benefit of it;</span> which he did as acutely in my judgment, <span class="it">as
ever I did hear any Man</span> in his own case in my life… And saith he, It is one of the
        Fundamentall Liberties of the Subjects of this Kingdom, <span class="it">to be tryed by</span>
        JURIES; and I hope you wil not deny me the benefit of the Parliaments Declaration, and <span
          class="it">so break it as soon as it is made</span>: but all was to no purpose, he must have no
        Jury, but Councell, if he would; at the denyall of which unto him, <span class="it">I confesse my
heart was ready to sink within me</span>, and my spirit was inwardly fill’d full of fire at these
        wretched men, whose now declared designs was cleer to tread under their feet all the Liberties of
        England, notwithstanding all their oathes and promises to the contrary; and then in that day in
        my own thoughts I clearly bid adieu unto all Englands glorious (amongst men) Libertties and
        dear-bought Freedoms, and much adoe had I in the open Court to containe my self from an <span
          class="it">avowed detestation</span> of their ABOMINABLE WICKEDNES, my heart was so full…</p>

    <p>Lucy Hutchinson and her husband viewed the trial with rather different emotions. They had shared
      some of the Levellers’ unease with the dominance of the military behind the establishment of the
      republic, and their close friend Henry Ireton had moved quite close to the Levellers in later 1648.
      The Levellers’ attacks on their allies in Parliament, however, went too far for them, and they
      threw their weight behind the new regime. Lucy Hutchinson explains that while Colonel Hutchinson
      had reservations about the illegality of the trial of Capel and the others, he also shared enough
      of the anti-aristocratic sentiment current amongst radicals at the time to wish to favor a commoner
      over any aristocrat: he championed Sir John Owen, who had prayed and taken the sacrament with Capel.

    <div class="q">
      <div class="q-block"></div>

      <p>This man [Sir John Owen] was wholly unknowne to him [Colonel Hutchinson], and with Duke
        Hamilton, the Earle of Holland, the Lord Capell, and the Lord Goring, condemn’d to death by a
        second High Court of justice; where, though the Collonell was nominated a Commissioner, he would
        not sitt, his unbloody nature desiring to spare the rest of the delinquents after the highest had
        suffer’d, and not delighting in the death of men when they could live without cruelty to better
        men. The Parliament alsoe was willing to shew mercy to some of these, and to execute others for
        example; whereupon the whole House was diversly engaged, some for one and some for another of
        these Lords, and striving to cast away those they were not concern’d in, that they might save
        their friends. And while there was such mighty labours and endeavours for these Lords, Collonell
        Hutchinson observ’d that no man spoke for this poore knight, and, sitting next to Collonell
        Ireton, he express’d himselfe to him and told him that it pittied him much to see that, while all
        were labouring to save the Lords, a gentleman that stood in the same condemnation should not find
        one friend to aske his life. “And so,” sayd he, “am I moov’d with compassion that, if you will
        second me, I am resolv’d to speake for him who I perceive is a stranger and friendlesse.” Ireton
        promis’d to second him, and accordingly enquiring further of the man’s condition, whether he had
        not a petition in any member’s hand, he found that his keepers had brought one to the Clearke of
        the House, but the man had not found any that would interest themselves for him, thinking the
        Lords’ lives of so much more concernment then the gentleman’s. This more stirr’d up the
        Collonell’s generous pitty, and he tooke the petition, deliver’d it, spoke for him so nobly, and
        was so effectually seconded by Collonell Ireton, that they carried his pardon cleare.</p>

    <p>Capel’s wife Elizabeth died in 1661. The Kentish poet Thomas Philipot published two tributes to
      her along with a reprint of his 1649 elegy for her husband. Using floral imagery for a conventional
      list of her virtues, he passes over her bold interventions for Capel.</p>
