      <p>Biblical depictions of the leviathan generally fall into one of two strains: terrifying monster linked to the Devil, or magnificent creation of God, evidence of his greatness and power. The first mention of the whale occurs in Genesis, when on the fourth day God creates the creatures of the sea.

      <p>Psalm 104, quoted by Spanish explorer José de Acosta in his description of whaling (see the Curation <ref target="#ctxs" type="pp-curations-ref">Whaling Legends/ref>), describes the Leviathan as a wondrous creation of God.</p>

      <p>In “This Huge Leviathan” (Emblem 42), Pulter compares her leviathan to the Hydra, a mythical snake with many heads. Psalm 74 similarly describes the leviathan as a sea monster with multiple heads. In this instance, God is described as having defeated the leviathan in a triumph of good over evil. The leviathan becomes food for “the people inhabiting the wilderness,” facing the same fate as Pulter’s whale.</p>

      <p>The Book of Job lists potential means of killing a whale. Job’s faith in the justice of God begins to fail after enduring several trials at the hands of Satan. In response, God addresses Job directly, describing his most magnificent creations, the behemoth and the leviathan, in order to display his supreme power. God compares the leviathan to a wild horse, claiming that the beast cannot be bridled. He also compares its heart to the “nether millstone,” a symbol of brute strength (Job 41:24). In a mill, the lower millstone is the stone that, under the weight of another rotating millstone, grinds grain into flour. Pulter’s description of whales working in mills in Emblem 42 was in fact inspired by a mistake in a travel book (see the Curation, <ref target="#ctxs" type="pp-curations-ref">Whales Working in Mills</ref>), but she was perhaps also aware of this biblical passage. In this chapter, God describes the nose and the nostrils of the leviathan, an image echoed in Pulter’s emblem and explorer accounts of Indigenous whaling.</p>
