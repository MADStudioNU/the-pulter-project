                <p>Many seventeenth-century writers wrote poems about gardens: as familiar, beloved spaces, sites of work (viewed positively or negatively), aspirations of pleasurable occupation, emblems of paradise, and models of human cognition and cultivation. Gathering some of them together here, one notices that women poets, including Pulter, seem to have taken up this topic before many of the male poets who subsequently wrote the poems on the topic that are now best known. One of the questions this raises is whether Marvell’s fantasy of a paradise without women (in his “The Garden”) is motivated in part by a desire to escape their competition and repudiate their inspiration.</p>

                        <li class="l">The brain a garden seems, full of delight,</li>
                        <li class="l">Whereon the sun of knowledge shineth bright,</li>
                        <li class="l">Where fancy flows, and runs in bubbling streams,</li>
                        <li class="l">Where flowers grow upon the banks of dreams,</li>
                        <li class="l">Whereon the dew of sleepy eyes doth fall,</li>
                        <li class="l">Bathing each leaf, and every flower small.</li>
                        <li class="l">There various thoughts as several flowers grow;</li>
                        <li class="l">Some milk-white innocence, as lilies, show.</li>
                        <li class="l">Fancies, as painted tulips’ colors fixed,</li>
                        <li class="l">By Nature’s pencils they are intermixed.</li>
                        <li class="l">Some as sweet roses, which are newly blown,</li>
                        <li class="l">Others as tender buds, not full outgrown.</li>
                        <li class="l">Some, as small violets, yet much sweetness bring.</li>
                        <li class="l">Thus many fancies from the brain still spring.</li>
                        <li class="l">Their wit, as butterflies, hot love do make,</li>
                        <li class="l">On every flower fine their pleasure take.</li>
                        <li class="l">Dancing about each leaf in pleasant sort,</li>
                        <li class="l">Passing their time away in amorous sport.</li>
                        <li class="l">Like Cupid’s young, their painted wings display,</li>
                        <li class="l">And with Apollo’s golden beams they play.</li>
                        <li class="l">Industry, as bees suck out the sweet,</li>
                        <li class="l">Wax of invention gather with their feet.</li>
                        <li class="l">Then on their wings of fame fly to their hive,</li>
                        <li class="l">From winter of sad death keeps them alive.</li>
                        <li class="l">There birds of poetry sweet notes still sing,</li>
                        <li class="l">Which through the world, as through the air, ring.</li>
                        <li class="l">Where on the branches of delight do sit,</li>
                        <li class="l">Pruning their wings, which are with study wet.</li>
                        <li class="l">Then to the cedars of high honor fly,</li>
                        <li class="l">Yet rest not there, but mount up to the sky.</li>

                        <li class="l">The place is always th’equinoctial.</li>
                        <li class="l">Echoes there are most artificial made,</li>
                        <li class="l">And cooling grottoes, from the heat to shade.</li>
                        <li class="l">The azure sky is always bright, and clear;</li>
                        <li class="l">No gross thick vapors in the clouds appear.</li>
                        <li class="l">There many stars do comfort the sad Night;</li>
                        <li class="l">The fixed with twinkling with the rest give light.</li>
                        <li class="l">No noise is heard, but what the ear delights;</li>
                        <li class="l">No fruits are there, but what the taste invites.</li>
                        <li class="l">Up through the nose bruised flowers fume the brain,</li>
                        <li class="l">As honeydew in balmy showers rain.</li>
                        <li class="l">Various colors, by Nature intermixed,</li>
                        <li class="l">Direct the eyes, as no one thing can fix.</li>
                        <li class="l">Here atoms small on sunbeams dance all day,</li>
                        <li class="l">While Zephyrus sweet doth on the air play,</li>
                        <li class="l">Which music from Apollo bears the praise,</li>
                        <li class="l">And Orpheus at the sound his harp down lays.</li>
                        <li class="l">Apollo yields, and not contends with spite,</li>
                        <li class="l">Presenting Zephyrus with twelve hours of light;</li>
                        <li class="l">And Night, though sad, in quiet pleasure takes,</li>
                        <li class="l">With silence listens when he music makes.</li>
                        <li class="l">And when Day comes, with grief descends down low,</li>
                        <li class="l">That she no longer must hear Zephyrus blow,</li>
                        <li class="l">And with her mantle black herself enshrouds,</li>
                        <li class="l">Which is embroidered all of stars in clouds.</li>
                        <li class="l">Here are intermixing walks of pleasure,</li>
                        <li class="l">Grass, sand, short, broad, and all sorts of measure.</li>
                        <li class="l">Some shaded, fit for lovers’ musing thought</li>
                        <li class="l">Of Love’s idea, when the mind’s full fraught.</li>
                        <li class="l">The walks are firm, and hard as marble are,</li>
                        <li class="l">Yet soft as down, by grass that groweth there,</li>
                        <li class="l">Where daisies grow as mushrooms, in a night,</li>
                        <li class="l">Mixed white, and yellow, green, to please the sight.</li>
                        <li class="l">At dawning Day the dew all overspreads,</li>
                        <li class="l">In little drops upon those daisies’ heads:</li>
                        <li class="l">As thick as stars are set in heaven high,</li>
                        <li class="l">So daisies on the earth as close do lie.</li>
                        <li class="l">Here emerald banks, from whence fine flowers spring,</li>
                        <li class="l">Whose scents and colors various pleasure bring.</li>
                        <li class="l">Primroses, cowslips, violets, daffodils,</li>
                        <li class="l">Roses, honeysuckles, and white lilies,</li>
                        <li class="l">Wallflowers, pinks, and marigolds besides,</li>
                        <li class="l">Sit on the bank, enriched with Nature’s pride.</li>
                        <li class="l">On other banks grow simples, which are good</li>
                        <li class="l">For medicines, well applied and understood.</li>
                        <li class="l">There trees do grow, that proper are, and tall,</li>
                        <li class="l">Their bark is smooth, and bodies sound withal;</li>
                        <li class="l">Whose spreading tops are full and evergreen</li>
                        <li class="l">As Nazarite’s heads where razor hath not been:</li>
                        <li class="l">And curled leaves, which bowing branches bear,</li>
                        <li class="l">By warmth are fed; for winter ne’er comes there.</li>
                        <li class="l">There fruits delicious to the taste do grow,</li>
                        <li class="l">Where with delight the sense doth overflow;</li>
                        <li class="l">And arched arbors, where sweet birds do sing,</li>
                        <li class="l">Whose hollow rooves do make each echo ring.</li>
                        <li class="l">Prospects, which trees and clouds by mixing shows,</li>
                        <li class="l">Joined by the eye, one perfect piece it grows.</li>
                        <li class="l">Here fountains are, where trilling drops down run,</li>
                        <li class="l">Which sparks do twinkle like fixed stars or sun;</li>
                        <li class="l">And through each several spout such noise it makes,</li>
                        <li class="l">As bird in spring, when he his pleasure takes.</li>
                        <li class="l">Some chirping sparrow, and the singing lark,</li>
                        <li class="l">Or quavering nightingale in evening dark;</li>
                        <li class="l">And whistling blackbird, with the pleasant thrush,</li>
                        <li class="l">Linnet, Bulfinch, which sing in every bush.</li>
                        <li class="l">No weeds are here, nor withered leaves and dry,</li>
                        <li class="l">But evergreen, and pleasant to the eye.</li>
                        <li class="l">No frost to nip the tender buds in birth,</li>
                        <li class="l">Nor winter snow to fall on this sweet earth.</li>
                        <li class="l">For here the Spring is always in her prime,</li>
                        <li class="l">Because this place is underneath the line:</li>
                        <li class="l">The Day and Night, equal, by turns keep watch,</li>
                        <li class="l">That thievish time should nothing from them catch.</li>
                        <li class="l">And every Muse a several walk enjoys,</li>
                        <li class="l">The sad in shades, the light with sports employs.</li>
                        <li class="l">Censuring satyrs: they in corners lurk;</li>
                        <li class="l">Yet, as their gard’ners, they with art do work,</li>
                        <li class="l">To cut and prune, to sow, engraft, and set,</li>
                        <li class="l">Gather fruits, flowers, what each Muse thinks fit:</li>
                        <li class="l">And nymphs, as handmaids, their attendance give,</li>
                        <li class="l">Which, for reward, their fames by Muses live.</li>

This is one of the poems Hutchinson seems to have composed after his death. In it, the speaker identifies with the “desolate garden.” “During his retirement from public life in the 1650s, [Col. Hutchinson] devoted considerable energy to remodelling his house and estate at Owthorpe in Nottinghamshire, and the ‘Elegies’ are haunted by his absence from this once-shared landscape” (David Norbrook, “Lucy Hutchinson’s ‘Elegies’ and the Situation of the Republican Woman Writer,” <span class="it">English Literary Renaissance</span> 27.3 (1997), pp. 468-521, esp. p. 469). Hutchinson’s improvements included “empaling” or enclosing his estate. —Dolan</div>

                    Cowley, whose work you will also find in the Curation <a href="#ctxs" class="pp-curations-ref">Parliaments of Flowers</a>, dedicated this poem to John Evelyn, a founding member of the Royal Society, an avid gardener, and the author of several important books on plants and gardening. In the dedicatory epistle, Cowley says of Evelyn: “I know nobody that possesses more private happiness than you do in your garden, and yet no man who makes his happiness more public by a free communication of the art and knowledge of it to others. All that I myself am able yet to do is only to recommend to mankind the search of that felicity which you instruct them how to find and to enjoy.” Cowley also describes his greedy desire “that I might be master at last of a small house and large garden, with very moderate conveniences joined to them, and there dedicate the remainder of my life only to the culture of them and the study of nature. And there (with no design beyond my wall) whole and entire to lie, in no unactive ease, and no unglorious poverty.” Thwarted thus far in this desire, Cowley offers this poem. Evelyn in turn dedicated the 1666 edition of his <span class="it">Kalendarium Hortense: or, The Gardener’s Almanac</span> to Cowley.

                    <ul class="lg">
                        <li class="l">Luxurious man, to bring his vice in use,</li>
                        <li class="l t-2">Did after him the world seduce,</li>
                        <li class="l">And from the fields the flowers and plants allure,</li>
                        <li class="l t-2">Where Nature was most plain and pure.</li>
                        <li class="l">He first inclosed within the gardens square</li>
                        <li class="l t-2">A dead and standing pool of air,</li>
                        <li class="l">And a more luscious earth for them did knead,</li>
                        <li class="l t-2">Which stupefied them while it fed.</li>
                        <li class="l">The pink grew then as double as his mind;</li>
                        <li class="l t-2">The nutriment did change the kind.</li>
                        <li class="l">With strange perfumes he did the roses taint;</li>
                        <li class="l t-2">And flowers themselves were taught to paint.</li>
                        <li class="l">The tulip white did for complexion seek,</li>
                        <li class="l t-2">And learned to interline its cheek;</li>
                        <li class="l">Its onion root they then so high did hold,</li>
                        <li class="l t-2">That one was for a meadow sold:</li>
                        <li class="l">Another world was searched through oceans new,</li>
                        <li class="l t-2">To find the marvel of Peru;</li>
                        <li class="l">And yet these rarities might be allowed</li>
                        <li class="l t-2">To man, that sovereign thing and proud,</li>
                        <li class="l">Had he not dealt between the bark and tree,</li>
                        <li class="l t-2">Forbidden mixtures there to see.</li>
                        <li class="l">No plant now knew the stock from which it came;</li>
                        <li class="l t-2">He grafts upon the wild the tame,</li>
                        <li class="l">That the uncertain and adulterate fruit</li>
                        <li class="l t-2">Might put the palate in dispute.</li>
                        <li class="l">His green seraglio has its eunuchs too,</li>
                        <li class="l t-2">Lest any tyrant him outdo;</li>
                        <li class="l">And in the cherry he does Nature vex,</li>
                        <li class="l t-2">To procreate without a sex.</li>
                        <li class="l">’Tis all enforced, the fountain and the grot,</li>
                        <li class="l t-2">While the sweet fields do lie forgot,</li>
                        <li class="l">Where willing Nature does to all dispense</li>
                        <li class="l t-2">A wild and fragrant innocence;</li>
                        <li class="l">And fauns and fairies do the meadows till</li>
                        <li class="l t-2">More by their presence than their skill.</li>
                        <li class="l">Their statues polished by some ancient hand,</li>
                        <li class="l t-2">May to adorn the gardens stand;</li>
                        <li class="l">But, howsoe’er the figures do excel,</li>
                        <li class="l t-2">The Gods themselves with us do dwell.</li>
                    </ul>
