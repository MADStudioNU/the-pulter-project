                <p>
                  A funeral sermon praises Lady Anne Clifford for dressing up her chamber with the “flowers of a library” written on papers and pinned up all over the room (Edward Rainbowe, Lord Bishop of Carlile, <span class="it">A Sermon Preached at the Funeral of the Right Honorable Anne, Countess of Pembroke, Dorset, and Montgomery</span> [London, 1677], sig. E4r–v). Here are what might have been some of the flowers of Hester Pulter’s library, the books that informed the histories, temperaments, and voices she assigns her flowers. Although Pulter might have been able to write “The Garden” without actually having a garden, it’s hard to imagine she could have written it without a library. Indeed, it’s hard to separate the two sources of inspiration. Books were regularly called gardens or bouquets; they inspired, described, and stood in for gardens (see, for instance, Leah Knight, <span class="it">Of Books and Botany in Early Modern England: Sixteenth-Century Plants and Print Culture</span> [Ashgate, 2009]). Gardens were valued as books of nature; Pulter makes her book a garden of talking, vibrant flowers. Flowers might even be embroidered onto book bindings, as here.

                <h4>The Story of Aphrodite and Anchises</h4>
                <p>
                  In Pulter’s poem, the Woodbine or honeysuckle tells the story of Aphrodite and Anchises. This ancient vase combines a double honeysuckle motif around the neck with the figures of Aeneas, his father Anchises, and Aphrodite.

                        <li class="l">The weary huntress usually here laves</li>
                        <li class="l">Her virgin limbs, more pure than those pure waves.</li>

                        <li class="l">And wand’ring through the woods, approached this grove</li>

                        <li class="l">The nymphs, all naked, when a man they viewed,</li>
                        <li class="l">Clapped their resounding breasts, and filled the wood</li>
                        <li class="l">With sudden shrieks. Like ivory pale, they stood</li>
                        <li class="l">About their goddess; but she, far more tall,</li>
                        <li class="l">By head and shoulders overtops them all.</li>
                        <li class="l">Such as that color, which the clouds adorns,</li>

                        <li class="l">She sidelong turns, looks back, and wished her bow.</li>
                        <li class="l">Yet, what she had, she in his face did throw.</li>
                        <li class="l">With vengeful waters sprinkled, to her rage</li>
                        <li class="l">These words she adds, which future Fate presage.</li>
                        <li class="l">“Now, tell how thou hast seen me disarrayed;</li>
                        <li class="l">Tell if thou canst. I give thee leave.” This said,</li>
                        <li class="l">She to his neck and ears new length imparts;</li>
                        <li class="l">T’his brow the antlers of long-living harts;</li>
                        <li class="l">His legs and feet with arms and hands supplied;</li>
                        <li class="l">And clothed his body in a spotted hide.</li>
                        <li class="l">To this, fear added. Autonoëius* flies,<div class="sidenote">*Acteon</div></li>
                        <li class="l">And wonders at the swiftness of his thighs.</li>
                        <li class="l">But when his looks he in the river viewed,</li>
                        <li class="l">He would have cried, “Woe’s me!”—No words ensued.</li>
                        <li class="l">His words were groans. He frets, with galling tears,</li>
                        <li class="l">Cheeks not his own; yet his own mind he bears.</li>
                        <li class="l">What should he do? Go home? Or in the wood</li>
                        <li class="l">Forever lurk? Fear, this; shame, that withstood.</li>
                        <li class="l">While thus he doubts, his dogs their master view:</li>
                        <li class="l">Blackfoot and Tracer, opening first, pursue:</li>
                        <li class="l">Sure Tracer, Gnossus, Blackfoot, Sparta bore.</li>
                        <li class="l">Then all fell in, more swift than forced air:</li>

                        <li class="l">Bred of a Spartan bitch, his sire of Crete;</li>
                        <li class="l">White-tooth, and Ring-wood (others not to express):</li>

                        <li class="l">Through straitened ways, and where there was no way,</li>
                        <li class="l">The well-mouthed hounds pursue the princely prey.</li>
                        <li class="l">Where oft he wont to follow, now he flies;</li>
                        <li class="l">Flies from his family! in thought he cries:</li>

                        <li class="l">Thoughts wanted words. High skies the noise record.</li>

                <p>As Adonis was born from a tree, so he became a flower in the story to which Pulter refers. Venus has warned Adonis against hunting but he did so anyway and was gored by a boar. She transforms him into a flower, both preserving him and commemorating the ephemerality of youth, beauty, and love. Here is the story of Adonis’s transformation, from Sandys’s translation of Ovid.</p>
