                <p>A funeral sermon praises Lady Anne Clifford for dressing up her chamber with the “flowers of a library” written on papers and pinned up all over the room (Edward Rainbowe, Lord Bishop of Carlile, <span class="it">A Sermon Preached at the Funeral of the Right Honorable Anne, Countess of Pembroke, Dorset, and Montgomery</span> [London, 1677], sig. E4r–v). Here are what might have been some of the flowers of Hester Pulter’s library, the books that informed the histories, temperaments, and voices she assigns her flowers. Although Pulter might have been able to write “The Garden” without actually having a garden, it’s hard to imagine she could have written it without a library. Indeed, it’s hard to separate the two sources of inspiration. Books were regularly called gardens or bouquets; they inspired, described, and stood in for gardens (see, for instance, Leah Knight, <span class="it">Of Books and Botany in Early Modern England: Sixteenth-Century Plants and Print Culture</span> [Ashgate, 2009]). Gardens were valued as books of nature; Pulter makes her book a garden of talking, vibrant flowers. Flowers might even be embroidered onto book bindings, as here.</p>

                <p>In Pulter’s poem, the Woodbine or honeysuckle tells the story of Aphrodite and Anchises. This ancient vase combines a double honeysuckle motif around the neck with the figures of Aeneas, his father Anchises, and Aphrodite.</p>

                        <li class="l">A vale there was with pines and cypress crowned,</li>

                        <li class="l">A shady cave possessed the inward part,</li>
                        <li class="l">Not wrought by hands; there Nature witty Art</li>
                        <li class="l">Did counterfeit: a native arch she drew,</li>
                        <li class="l">With pumice and light tophuses that grew.</li>
                        <li class="l">A bubbling spring, with streams as clear as glass,</li>
                        <li class="l">Ran chiding by, enclosed with matted grass.</li>
                        <li class="l">The weary huntress usually here laves</li>
                        <li class="l">Her virgin limbs, more pure than those pure waves.</li>
                        <li class="l">And now her bow, her jav’lin, and her quiver</li>
                        <li class="l">Doth to a nymph, one of her squires, deliver;</li>
                        <li class="l">Her light impoverished robes another held;</li>
                        <li class="l">Her buskins two untie. The better skilled</li>

                        <li class="l">In plaited-wreaths: yet was her own unbound.</li>

                        <li class="l">Employed) and Phiale the lavers fill.</li>
                        <li class="l">While here Titania bathed (as was her guise),</li>
                        <li class="l">Lo, Cadmus’s nephew, tired with exercise,</li>
                        <li class="l">And wand’ring through the woods, approached this grove</li>
                        <li class="l">With fatal steps: so destiny him drove!</li>
                        <li class="l">Ent’ring the cave with skipping springs bedewed,</li>
                        <li class="l">The nymphs, all naked, when a man they viewed,</li>
                        <li class="l">Clapped their resounding breasts, and filled the wood</li>
                        <li class="l">With sudden shrieks. Like ivory pale, they stood</li>
                        <li class="l">About their goddess; but she, far more tall,</li>
                        <li class="l">By head and shoulders overtops them all.</li>
                        <li class="l">Such as that color, which the clouds adorns,</li>
                        <li class="l">Shot by the sunbeams or the rosy morns:</li>
                        <li class="l">Such flushed in Dian’s cheeks, being naked ta’en.</li>
                        <li class="l">And though environed by her virgin train,</li>
                        <li class="l">She sidelong turns, looks back, and wished her bow.</li>
                        <li class="l">Yet, what she had, she in his face did throw.</li>
                        <li class="l">With vengeful waters sprinkled, to her rage</li>
                        <li class="l">These words she adds, which future Fate presage.</li>
                        <li class="l">“Now, tell how thou hast seen me disarrayed;</li>
                        <li class="l">Tell if thou canst. I give thee leave.” This said,</li>
                        <li class="l">She to his neck and ears new length imparts;</li>
                        <li class="l">T’his brow the antlers of long-living harts;</li>
                        <li class="l">His legs and feet with arms and hands supplied;</li>
                        <li class="l">And clothed his body in a spotted hide.</li>
                        <li class="l">To this, fear added. Autonoëius [Acteon] flies,</li>
                        <li class="l">And wonders at the swiftness of his thighs.</li>
                        <li class="l">But when his looks he in the river viewed,</li>
                        <li class="l">He would have cried, “Woe’s me!”––No words ensued.</li>
                        <li class="l">His words were groans. He frets, with galling tears,</li>
                        <li class="l">Cheeks not his own; yet his own mind he bears.</li>
                        <li class="l">What should he do? Go home? Or in the wood</li>
                        <li class="l">Forever lurk? Fear, this; shame, that withstood.</li>
                        <li class="l">While thus he doubts, his dogs their master view:</li>
                        <li class="l">Blackfoot and Tracer, opening first, pursue:</li>
                        <li class="l">Sure Tracer, Gnossus, Blackfoot, Sparta bore.</li>
                        <li class="l">Then all fell in, more swift than forced air:</li>
                        <li class="l">Spy, Ravener, Climb-cliff:  these Arcadia bred.</li>
                        <li class="l">Strong Fawn-bane, Whirlwind, eager Follow-dread;</li>
                        <li class="l">Hunter––for scent; for speed, Flight went before;</li>
                        <li class="l">Fierce Salvage, lately ganched [gashed] by a boar;</li>
                        <li class="l">Greedy, with her two whelps; grim Wolf-got Ranger;</li>
                        <li class="l">Stout Shepherd, late preserving flocks from danger;</li>
                        <li class="l">Gaunt Catch, whose race from Sicyonia came;</li>
                        <li class="l">Patch, Courser, Blab, rash Tiger, never tame;</li>
                        <li class="l">Blanch, Mourner, Roister, Wolf surpassing strong;</li>
                        <li class="l">And Tempest, able to continue long;</li>
                        <li class="l">Swift, with his brother Churl, a Cyprian hound;</li>
                        <li class="l">Bold Snatch, whose sable brows a white star crowned;</li>
                        <li class="l">Cole, shag-haired Rug, and Light-foot, wondrous fleet,</li>
                        <li class="l">Bred of a Spartan bitch, his sire of Crete;</li>
                        <li class="l">White-tooth, and Ring-wood (others not to express):</li>
                        <li class="l">O’er rocks, o’er crags, o’er cliffs that want access,</li>
                        <li class="l">Through straitened ways, and where there was no way,</li>
                        <li class="l">The well-mouthed hounds pursue the princely prey.</li>
                        <li class="l">Where oft he wont to follow, now he flies;</li>
                        <li class="l">Flies from his family! in thought he cries:</li>
                        <li class="l">“I am Actaeon, servants, know your Lord!”</li>
                        <li class="l">Thoughts wanted words. High skies the noise record.</li>
                        <li class="l">First, Collier pinched him by the haunch: in flung</li>
                        <li class="l">Fierce Kill-dear; Hill-bred on his shoulder hung.</li>
                        <li class="l">These came forth last; but crossed a nearer way</li>
                        <li class="l">A-thwart the hills. While thus their Lord they stay,</li>
                        <li class="l">In rush the rest, who gripe him with their fangs.</li>
                        <li class="l">Now is no room for wounds. Groans speak his pangs,</li>
                        <li class="l">Though not with humane voice, unlike a hart</li>
                        <li class="l">In whose laments the known rocks bear a part.</li>
                        <li class="l">Pitched on his knees, like one who pity craves,</li>
                        <li class="l">His silent looks, instead of arms, he waves.</li>
                        <li class="l">With usual shouts their dogs the hunters cheer;</li>
                        <li class="l">And seek, and call “Actaeon.” He (too near!)</li>
                        <li class="l">Made answer by mute motions, blamed of all</li>
                        <li class="l">For being absent at his present fall.</li>
                        <li class="l">Present he was, that absent would have been;</li>
                        <li class="l">Nor would his cruel hounds have felt, but seen.</li>
                        <li class="l">Their snouts they in his body bathe; and tear</li>
                        <li class="l">Their master in the figure of a deer.</li>

                <p>As Adonis was born from a tree, so he became a flower in the story to which Pulter refers. Venus has warned Adonis against hunting but he did so anyway and was gored by a boar. She transforms him into a flower, both preserving him and commemorating the ephemerality of youth, beauty, and love. Here is the story of Adonis’s transformation, from Sandys’s translation of Ovid.</p>
