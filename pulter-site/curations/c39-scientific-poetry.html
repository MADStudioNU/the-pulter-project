  How “scientific” is “The Perfection of Patience and Knowledge,” in particular its middle section which uses the vocabularies of alchemy and astronomy? Pulter’s poem <a href="/poems/21" class="pp-poem-ref" title="Poem 21: The Circle [2]" target="_blank">“The Circle [2]” (Poem 21)</a> may be the best answer to this question. In “The Circle [2]” we see a poem built around the precise use of alchemical vocabulary:

  The enthusiastic embrace of, and use of, alchemical, chemical, astronomical, and other scientific vocabularies was not uncommon in this period that also saw the Scientific Revolution; we see, for instance, references to Galileo’s telescope in John Milton’s <span class="it">Paradise Lost</span>, and Richard Leigh wrote a paean to the scientific technologies of telescope and microscope in his poem “Greatness in Little”:

  While poems like Leigh’s report on (and gush over) the newest exciting advancements of science, other poets seem to warn rather against the desire to know everything of nature, and in particular to try to know everything of the heavenly spheres. In a famous scene in Milton’s <span class="it">Paradise Lost</span>, Adam asks about the motions of the heavens and other worlds. Raphael, to whom Adam asks these questions, quibbles slightly in his response, leading to the famous exchange given below (with highlights bolded). Like Pulter in “Perfection” line 50, Milton gestures to the possible “treble motion” of the Earth, only to refuse to decide, ultimately, on cosmological matters. Better, Raphael suggests near the end of the excerpt below, for Adam to remain “lowly wise” than to trouble himself with such matters.

<p>
  Did Milton truly believe that seeking natural knowledge was a waste compared to seeking the more perfect knowledge of God? It is perhaps tempting to read sarcasm into Adam’s response; given that Raphael gives Adam rebukes rather than answers to his questions, what does it mean for Milton to describe Adam as being “cleerd of doubt” immediately after?
</p>
<p>
  To ask the question of whether “The Perfection of Patience and Knowledge” is scientific, then, may require not seeking after scientific content, but rather wondering whether something about its disjunctive form requires, or even shapes, different modes of thought. As I have suggested in a recently published chapter (Liza Blake, “Lyric and Scientific Epistemologies: Bacon and Donne,” In <span class="it">Gathering Force: Early Modern British Literature in Transition, 1557–1623</span>, vol. I, ed. Kristen Poole and Lauren Shohet [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2019], 199–214), maybe it would be more productive not to go looking for citations of scientific ideas and figures, but instead to think about how forms of poetry are shaping thoughts in new and different ways in response to the changing epistemologies of the Scientific Revolution. I end this curation, then, with Donne’s poem “The Damp,” which like Pulter’s “Perfection of Patience and Knowledge” seems to conjure scientific specifics (in Donne’s case, the scene of the anatomy theater), only to embed that scene in a poetic puzzle, “a maze” for the reader to wander through, or wonder at.
