      In many of her poems, Pulter is fascinated with the idea and symbolism of dust, from its Biblical connotations as the earth from which Adam was made (and will return), from which John Milton drew in <span class="it">Paradise Lost</span>, to the alchemical notions of dust as purified matter, yet purity which is easily mistaken for the ashes or dregs of the transformation. <span class="it">The Book of Common Prayer</span>, which laid out the forms of worship for the post-Reformation church in England, has Biblically-inflected “dust” in its funeral service. In George Herbert’s poem “Church Monuments” we can see how dust represented both the solidity of matter and its transience in devotional lyric.

      <p>Genesis 2:7<br/>
        And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and
        man became a living soul.
      </p>
      <p>Genesis 3:19<br/>
        In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken:
        for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
      </p>
      <p>Genesis 18:27<br/>
        And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and
        ashes:
      </p>
      <p>Psalm 103:13-15<br/>
        Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.
        For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
        As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.

    <h3>Alchemical Dust</h3>

        <span class="it">Dust</span>: the whitened, purified body of the Stone attained through sublimation, also known as ash, snow, white
        foliated earth and Bird of Hermes. <span class="it">The Rosary of the Philosophers</span> says of the dust:
        “when it shall ascend most white as Snow, it will be compleat, therefore gather it carefully, lest it fly away
        into smoke, because that is the very sought for good, the white foliated Earth.” The <span class="it">Clangor Buccinae</span>
        advised the alchemist to sublime the body of the Stone and boil it with mercury “until it ascends in likenesse
        of most white Dust, adhering to the sides of the Vessell in manner of Snow, But the Ashes remaining in the
        bottome are dregs, and the vilified drosse of Bodies, and to be cast away, in which there is no life because it
        is a most light Dust, which with a little blast vanisheth.” Arthur Wilson referred to the alchemical dust,
        meaning “dregs,” in a dedicatory poem to Edward Benlowes: “By sacred Chymistrie, the <span
        class="it">Spirit</span> must / Ascend and leave the Sediment to Dust.” Aristotle equated the purified body or
        white dust with the Hermes Bird: “Whiten the Earth, and Sublime it quickly with Fire, until the Spirit which
        thou shalt finde in it goe forth of it, and it is called <span class="it">Hermes Bird</span>; for that which
        ascends higher is efficacious purity but that which fals to the bottome, is drosse and corruption. This
        therefore is Dust drawn from Dust, and the begotten of the Philosophers, the white foliated Earth, in which Gold
        is to be sowne.”
