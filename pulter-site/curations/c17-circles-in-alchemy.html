      Circles featured symbolically in alchemy, for both the processes and the vessels involved.

    <div class="q">
      <p>
        <span class="it">Circle</span>: the symbol of perfection. The circle signifies the perfect, eternal spiritual
        realm in contrast to the square, which signifies the earth, the corruptible world of illusion, the four
        elements, the four arms of the earthly cross. The circle with the dot in the centre symbolizes, at the
        macrocosmic level, gold. The completed opus alchymicum is also symbolized by the circle.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="it">Circulatory</span>: an alembic [a vessel used for distilling] with a neck bent back,
        re-entering its lower part, used for the purpose of continuous distillation.

        On one level, the “Circle” of [Pulter’s] title refers to the <span class="it">ouroboros</span>, the
        self-birthing snake (sometimes dragon) that devours its own tail. This is the ancient symbol of eternity, the
        perfection of art and of the completion of the alchemical opus (the <span class="it">opus circulatorium</span>).
        Superficially, it is a positive image of unity. It represents life as an ongoing cycle of birth and death, and
        the alchemical opus as a continuing series of acts of creation and recreation, progress and refinement. In
        alchemical texts, the <span class="it">ouroboros</span> is mapped on to two other spaces, the womb and the
        alembic (the vessel or retort, within which alchemical processes take place). Both spaces are associated with
