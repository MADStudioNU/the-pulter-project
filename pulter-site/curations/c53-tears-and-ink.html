                <p>The tears-as-ink metaphor enacts crying, weeping, and sobbing, all of which had complicated and sometimes contradictory meanings.</p>
                <p>Early-modern poets played with the humoral relationship between ink and bodily fluids, including blood, sweat, and tears. Putting pen to ink could function as bloodletting, emetics, or laxatives;<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-0-1" id="fna-0-1">1</a> these medical procedures could balance or distort the writer’s physiology. Bloodletting, for instance, was thought to be a cure for heartbreak.<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-0-2" id="fna-0-2">2</a> Crying could similarly serve a humoral purpose, releasing cold and wet vapours from the body, which would stimulate a drier and hotter state.<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-0-3" id="fna-0-3">3</a> Since, according to humoral theory, men naturally tend towards being hot and dry and women naturally tend towards being cold and wet,<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-0-4" id="fna-0-4">4</a> crying comes more readily to women,<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-0-5" id="fna-0-5">5</a> whereas crying could help a man who was overwhelmed with wet and cold, which would need dispelling.</p>
                <p>But crying was complex<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-0-6" id="fna-0-6">6</a> and could be understood in other ways: tears could reflect genuine sorrow and regret, and thereby facilitate repentance and forgiveness of sin.<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-0-7" id="fna-0-7">7</a> Conversely, crying could be falsely adopted as a performance;<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-0-8" id="fna-0-8">8</a> crying, especially for women, could be suspect and seen as deceptive, insincere, or indulgent.<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-0-9" id="fna-0-9">9</a></p>

                <p>In Sidney’s sonnet, the speaker details some of the ways in which lovers respond to their muse. Some lovers are inspired to an oxymoronic “sweet plaint,” in which tears and sighs serve as conduits for elegiac poetry.</p>

                <p>In Alabaster’s poem, both the speaker’s tears and Christ’s blood serve as ink. With his repentant tears as his ink and his tongue as his pen, the speaker records his sins. Christ then erases those records with his sacrificial body in the form of the communion bread.<a class="lato place-above fn-num" href="#fn-0-10" id="fna-0-10">10</a> Here, the metaphor emphasizes the materiality of Christ’s sacrifice.</p>
