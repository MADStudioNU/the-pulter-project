      <h2>Scholarship</h2>
      <p>
        Pulter studies only began in the late twentieth century, when the <a href="https://explore.library.leeds.ac.uk/special-collections-explore/7610/poems_breathed_forth_by_the_nobel_hadassas_and_th?query=pulter&resultOffset=2" target="_blank">manuscript</a> containing her writing came to light at the University of Leeds Library as part of an institutional <a href="https://explore.library.leeds.ac.uk/special-collections-explore/Brotherton%20Collection%20Manuscript%20Verse%20Index" target="_blank">indexing</a> of the manuscript verse held in the Brotherton Collection. Mark Robson’s involvement in this project brought the manuscript to light and led to his early publications on Pulter, including her biography in the <span class="it">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the late 1990s, Elizabeth Clarke helped foster research on Pulter and added her manuscript to the Perdita Project, a crucial database of early modern women’s manuscript writing which was officially launched in 2005. Around the same time, Sarah C. E. Ross’s dissertation research developed into several articles on Pulter and editions of selections from her manuscript, followed more recently by substantial studies in <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/women-poetry-and-politics-in-seventeenth-century-britain-9780198724209" target="_blank"><span class="it">Women, Poetry, and Politics in Seventeenth-Century Britain</span></a> and an anthology, <a href="http://www.manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/9781526128706/" target="_blank"><span class="it">Women Poets of the Civil War</span></a> (co-edited with Elizabeth Scott-Baumann).
      </p>
      <p>
        Editions of selections from Pulter’s verse began to appear in printed anthologies as early as 2001, but an edition of her work as a whole did not appear in print until 2014, with Alice Eardley’s edition of her complete poetry and prose, <a href="//crrs.ca/publications/ov32/" target="_blank"><span class="it">Poems, Emblems, and The Unfortunate Florinda</span></a>. Eardley has also contributed substantially to the development of scholarship on Pulter in various articles as well as in the extensive introduction to her edition. Another edition of the complete verse, complemented by an in-depth introduction, may be found in Stefan Graham Christian’s 2012 dissertation. The University of Leeds has made the manuscript publicly accessible via high-resolution <a href="//explore.library.leeds.ac.uk/special-collections-explore/7610/poems_breathed_forth_by_the_nobel_hadassas_and_th?query=pulter&resultOffset=2" target="_blank">images</a>.

        The following list of publications will be updated periodically. We seek to provide a complete inventory of items that directly and <span class="it">substantially</span> respond to her work. The most recent items are presented first; within each year, works are arranged alphabetically by author surname. We welcome suggestions for making the list as comprehensive as possible.
