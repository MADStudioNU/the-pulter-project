For example, what according to modern usage is incorrect subject/verb agreement might have been deemed acceptable to a seventeenth-century scribe or compositor. All such instances are treated instead using the ORIG and REG tags. (See below.)</p>
          <p>Corrections and annotations made within the scope of the original document either by its original authors, owners, and/or transcribers are noted using ADD tags.

            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

              <note type="headnote">By offering examples of how diminutive and seemingly insignificant things (flies, worms, clothes) can overcome even the mightiest people, this emblem warns against the vanity of human overconfidence and pride (vices that Pulter sees in the tyrannies of English politics of the day). The central conceit is of a magisterial ship able to battle and survive the worst ocean storms; Pulter develops this conventional metaphor of the ship of state by asking the reader to imaginatively fuse two stories of sailors battling the elements: Aeneas, in conflict with the goddess Juno when fleeing Troy, and King James VI of Scotland (later James I of England), who believed witches tried to wreck him and his queen at sea as an attack on royal power. As it turns out, small suckerfish–invisibly glued to the keel of a boat–could accomplish what powerful tempests at sea could not: halt the ship in its tracks. The poem’s central image of an anchored ship morphs at this point in the poem into numerous sailing vessels from Roman and Greek histories, all of which succumbed to the unexpected power of a something lower down on the food chain.</note>
