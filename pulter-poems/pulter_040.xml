            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

            <note type="editorialnote">In order to provide another perspective on Pulter’s poem and situate it within the period, the original spelling and—perhaps more significantly—punctuation has been preserved in this edition. Despite the fact that early modern spelling, punctuation and capitalization rules were non-standardized in the period, Stefan Christian (2012: 82) notes that Pulter’s punctuation was probably chosen by a scribe in consultation with the poet.</note>

            <note type="headnote">How do you comfort a troubled soul? Here, the answer rests in the promise of a future radical change, in metamorphosis as both a religious and poetic principle. While in neighboring poems, the speaker urges the soul to be patient until the glories of the afterlife, or to freely let go of its earthly body, here she offers reassurance that habitation on earth is merely temporary. The consolation offered is superficially cast in terms of a standard Christian duality of body versus soul. But, in fact, Pulter complicates the matter by warning the soul that its “mortal nature” will corrode to ashes and disintegrate to the fundamental Aristotelian elements. The body and soul emerge less as distinctive entities than fungible elements making up a being. This disruption of Christian orthodoxy continues when the speaker conditionally credits the Pythagorean theory that the soul transmigrates at death into the body of another creature. If Pythagoras is right, she reassures her anxious soul, it surely will evolve into a lamb or dove (Christian icons) rather than a lowly toad. Although the poem ends with the comforting finale in which the soul is swallowed into heaven with amnesia about its earthly existence, the core principle celebrated by the poem is the vitality of transmutation, registered in the poem’s content, in its uncertain shifts between first-and second-person address (which confuse soul and body), and in its formal rhyme words: “Then whether dissolution, / Or transmigration, / Or rolling revolution, / All ends in thy salvation.” The final twist is Pulter’s decision to write in what was known as “common measure,” a popular ballad form of writing. The move away from rhymed couplets to quatrains of alternating tetrameter and trimeter performs Pulter’s investment in revolutions of form.</note>

              <p>In this poem, the speaker addresses her own soul and, in so doing, engages with a number of devotional and poetic traditions without letting those traditions confine her. On the one hand, her poem can be read in relation to the body and soul dialogue poem, a tradition rooted in medieval literature but still popular in the seventeenth century, as attested by Anne Bradstreet’s “The Flesh and the Spirit” and Andrew Marvell’s “A Dialogue Between the Soul and the Body.” Alternatively, her poem could also be read within the devotional tradition of the apostrophe to the soul and be compared to Shakespeare’s Sonnet 146, which begins, “Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth.”<seg>1<note type="gloss"><bibl>William Shakespeare, <ref target="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45109/sonnet-146-poor-soul-the-centre-of-my-sinful-earth" type="new-window-url">Sonnet 146. </ref> <title rend="italic">Poetry Foundation</title>, l. 1.</bibl></note></seg> Line 15 likely points to John Donne’s famous apostrophe to death in his holy sonnet “Death be not proud”: “One short sleep past, we wake eternally, / And Death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.”<seg>2<note type="gloss"><bibl>John Donne, Holy Sonnet 10, <ref target="https://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/donne/sonnet10.php" type="new-window-url">“Death, be not proud.” </ref> <title rend="italic">Luminarium.org</title>, ll. 13–14.</bibl></note></seg> These somewhat diverse devotional traditions share underlying assumptions about the body/soul dichotomy and the need to vocally and actively repent. Such poems frequently use imagery of violence to articulate the soul’s need to be brought back into submission to God.<seg>3<note type="gloss"><bibl>Nikolina Hatton, Curation <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Metaphors of Violence in Devotional Poetry</ref>. </bibl></note></seg> This devotional poetic tradition often, as Abe Davies has pointed out, functions as a means of disciplining the speaker and the reader.<seg>4<note type="gloss"><bibl>See Abe Davies, <title rend="italic">Imagining the Soul in Premodern Literature</title> (Cham: Palgrave Macmillan, 2021), pp. 121–162.</bibl></note></seg> Pulter’s use of the apostrophe to the soul in this and other poems (<ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="28">O, My Afflicted Solitary Soul</ref>, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="39">The Perfection of Patience and Knowledge</ref>, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="47">Why Art Thou Sad at the Approach of Night</ref>) intervenes in this tradition of addressing the soul and offers an alternative approach: instead of admonishing the soul (or body) to repentance, she uses the devotional form to provide comfort and consolation to her soul as she meditates on the promise of the resurrection.</p>
              <p>The speaker’s consolatory tone and poetic stance in this poem bear similarities to her tone in another subset of her poems that are modeled on the biblical psalms, such as <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="18">The Desire</ref> and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="24">How Long Shall My Dejected Soul</ref>.<seg>5<note type="gloss"><bibl>See Hatton, Nikolina, <ref target="https://doi.org/10.1111/rest.12821" type="new-window-url">“Hester Pulter’s Psalmic Poems,” </ref> <title rend="italic">Renaissance Studies</title> 37, no. 3 (2023): pp. 364–83.</bibl></note></seg> Although not addressed to God, this poem itself has a number of features that align it with the psalms, not the least of which is her opening (ll. 1-2) which bears a striking similarity to Ps. 43: 5: “Why art thou cast downe, O my soule? and why art thou disquieted within me?”<seg>6<note type="gloss"><bibl>Psalms 43:5. <title rend="italic">The Holy Bible</title>, Authorized Version, (London, 1611). EEBO.</bibl> This is a refrain that echoes similar verses in Psalms 42:5 and 11. For the sake of simplicity, I have chosen to focus on only one. See also Nikolina Hatton, Curation <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Pulter’s Psalmic Intertexts</ref>.</note></seg> Additionally, the poem’s meter, quatrains of alternating tetrameter and trimeter, rhyming <hi rend="italic">abab</hi>, link it with <title rend="italic">The Whole Book of Psalms</title>, i.e., the “Sternhold and Hopkins” metrical psalter, a psalter often used in English church services for singing psalms to popular tunes in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.<seg>7<note type="gloss"><bibl>Beth Quitslund, “The Psalm Book” in <title rend="italic">The Elizabethan Top Ten: Defining Print Popularity in Early Modern England</title>, eds. Andy Kesson and Emma Smith (Farnham: Ashgate, 2013), pp. 203–11.</bibl></note></seg> Poem 40 is the only instance in her manuscript in which she turns to this ‘common meter.’ But here too, as with her consolatory apostrophe to the soul, the speaker destabilizes the expectations of her reader.</p>
              <p>The first four stanzas contain references to the psalms and Donne, and the poem continues to the end in a rough version of this popular meter, but Pulter’s content engages with more heterodox ideas about the body and soul than these formal allusions suggest. In castigating the world in these opening stanzas, Pulter at first seems to be endorsing a material/spiritual dichotomy in which the soul must first endure a “terrene” (l. 9) existence before being liberated to heaven, but the poem also presents alternatives to this view. In line 13, she points to the soul’s “Mortall Nature,” potentially signaling an unorthodox belief that the soul dies with the body.<seg>8<note type="gloss">See Kenneth Graham’s Curation <ref type="pp-curation-ref" target="/poems/ee/aurora-2/#christian-mortalism">Christian Mortalism from the Bible to Pulter</ref>.</note></seg> In stanzas five through seven, she continues this heterodox exploration by discussing a number of theories of the afterlife that have their sources outside the Christian tradition. From the impersonal yet oddly gendered “black Oblivion’s womb” in line 20 to references to Empedoclean physics (ll. 21–22) or even Pythagorian reincarnation (ll. 25­–28), the speaker never settles on one solution. Perhaps these ideas allow the poet to imagine alternatives to the body/soul/self problem with which so much Christian devotional poetry is plagued, as attested by the subtle shift in pronouns from “thou” to “I,” beginning in line 23.<seg>9<note type="gloss">For more on the body/soul problem, see Liza Blake’s Curation <ref type="pp-curation-ref" target="/poems/ee/the-perfection-of-patience-and-knowledge/#body-soul-dust">Body, Soul, Dust</ref>.</note></seg> Pulter’s use of conjunctions further hints at her attitude toward all these possibilities. Her reiteration of “or” suggests her openness to other heterodox possibilities, while “whether” and “if” are always followed by assurances that even should these theories be true, she is assured of Christian resurrection: “All ends in thy Salvation” (l. 32). Establishing this belief early on (see ll. 7–8) and reiterating it throughout provides a firm foundation from which she can contemplate less traditional understandings of the body and soul without anxiety.</p>
              <p>In the last three stanzas, the poem looks to a future—with a reiteration of “then” (ll. 29, 33, 37)—in which Pulter’s pain will have been erased. Here, the speaker returns to a mode recognizable in the biblical psalms, one that is consolatory, even elegiac, an attempt to offer her soul comfort in its distress. Both Psalms 42 and 43 end on such a note, with the speaker imagining a future state of thanksgiving. Rather than thematizing penitence, both of these psalms are more concerned with the speaker lamenting the lack of justice in her situation and articulating a longing to be returned to a state of community. In fact, Pulter’s entire poem may be an expanded meditation on Ps. 43:5, the second part of which continues: “hope in God, for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.” Similarly to the biblical psalmist in this verse, the poet opens her poem with an apostrophe to the soul, asking why she despairs, writes an extended meditation on her hope of resurrection (whatever form it takes) and finishes with an expression of faith in future joy in these final stanzas. This latter upward movement towards imagining future hope, although arguably inspired by the psalms, is another hallmark of devotional poetry, particularly that of the poems of George Herbert, once again signaling Pulter’s knowledge of and engagement with the devotional form.<seg>10<note type="gloss"><bibl>See Ross, Sarah C.
