Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

              <note type="editorialnote">Our priority in editing these poems has been to modernise, and to achieve interpretative and visual clarity, in order to make the poems as accessible as possible to as wide a modern audience as is possible. Spelling is modernised, as is punctuation. Modernising the latter, in particular, often involves a significant act of editorial interpretation, but in our view this is one of the most productive areas of editorial intervention, particularly for a manuscript text such as Pulter’s where the punctuation is erratic compared to modern usage (and, indeed, compared to early modern printed texts). All biblical references are to the King James Version (1612).</note>

              <note type="headnote">Building on the last lines of the previous emblem, which portray the speaker’s spiritual ascent up a staircase, Pulter imagines her children joining her in the arduous and difficult climb toward the shining heaven where her eight dead children now reside. In this poem, the speaker adopts the role of a spiritual teacher and revises the invitation genre, which Pulter uses elsewhere in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="2">The Invitation to the Country</ref> and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="38">To My Dear Jane, Margaret, and Penelope Pulter, They Being at London, I at Broadfield</ref>. She invites her children to learn the sequence of stages in which twelve personified virtues should be mastered as part of an ascent toward God. The guide for this journey is scripture, personified as the Greek figure Aletheia (or Truth), who lends a steady hand to keep the aspiring Christian from plunging headlong backwards (or to Hell). The speaker’s authority strikingly inheres in her position as a Christ-like mediator of Truth: “Even as I follow Christ, so follow me,” she states. In the manuscript, the didacticism of the poem is enhanced by a numbered list of the virtues inscribed in the left margin.</note>

            <note type="headnote">
                <p>Pulter’s second emblem completes what can be read as a prefatory pair. The image of godly steps established in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="67">Mighty Nimrod (Emblem 1)</ref> is pursued, as Pulter invokes a figurative sequence of steps via a list of twelve virtues, suggesting that, by following them exactly, one will achieve everlasting happiness. These steps are not only described in the poem, they are also outlined in the left-hand margin, and the presentation of this list in the manuscript deserves attention: the notes are written in the scribal hand, suggesting they are part of the original text, and they are carefully numbered. Because this suggests that the marginal notes are integral to the poem, we have retained them as part of the main text in this edition.</p>
                <p>The visual effect of this marginal listing is striking, as it sets out in a clear sequence the virtuous steps that the didactic poem details. George Herbert’s pattern poems in <title rend="italic">The Temple</title> (1633) are salient examples of giving language “visual and sacred significance”, and they would have been well known to Pulter. See “The Altar,” “Easter wings” and “The Church-floore” (Wilcox, <title rend="italic">The English Poems of George Herbert</title> [New York: Cambridge University Press, 2007], 89-94, 143-149, 244). The last of these closely parallels this emblem; as we show in our Curation, <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Blessed Steps</ref>, Herbert aligns each step up “the gentle [rise]” to the quire with a specific virtue, visualizing these steps in the poem’s layout to aid his didactic preoccupation. Pulter similarly uses what Leah Marcus calls “visual punning”, a technique used by Herbert, which shows the poet “building words into a sacred game for the glory of his heavenly father” (<title rend="italic">Childhood and Cultural Despair</title> [Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1978], 110). Pulter therefore maintains her use of “naked” emblems while employing a visual representation, via the listing, of the steps she will “ascend” (Wilcox 110; Eardley 28).</p>
                <p>In this emblem, Pulter explicitly addresses her children, engaging in a modified version of the invitation poem as she solicits them to learn  and practice the sequential stages of virtue which must be followed to ascend God’s path to Heaven. (For more on Pulter’s use of the invitation genre, see note for line 1.) Combining Christian religion with classical mythology, Pulter draws on God and Aletheia, the Greek goddess of truth, as her guides along the path of virtue. The invitational aspects of this poem grant her a sense of authority, as she utilizes both her poetic and motherly status to enhance the moral didacticism of the emblem. This feminized rhetoric of instruction also draws on the ‘mother’s legacy’ genre, which was a popular genre women utilised to creative private, often posthumous, communication with their children. See Elizabeth Joscelin’s poetry in <title rend="italic">Women’s Writing in Stuart England: The Mothers’ Legacies of Dorothy Leigh, Elizabeth Joscelin, and Elizabeth Richardson</title>, ed. by Sylvia Brown [Stroud: Sutton, 1999]. Evidently conscious of her feminized position as a mother and woman writer, Pulter conveys a linear sense of moral education in her second emblem, as she finds guidance in “God’s word” and the hand of Aletheia, and then imparts this to her children. She becomes a mediator to guide them on the difficult path of virtue to avoid any “tumbl[ing] down” into Hell (line 29).</p>

          <rdg wit="#ae" rend="left-gutter-1"><seg>Come, my dear children<note type="critical">Pulter plays with the conventions of the invitation poem, a genre which features the trope of rural retreat, or the act of drawing away from a political landscape into a space of devout meditation; see Pulter’s pastoral poems <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="2">The Invitation into the Country</ref> and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="38">To My Dear Jane, Margaret, and Penelope Pulter, They Being at London, I at Broadfield</ref> in which she implores her children to retreat with her to Broadfield, her country estate. In this emblem, Pulter’s invitation, while addressed to her children, diverges in that it asks them to “come” and be happy in faith. This edifying imperative is given by Christ in Matthew 11.28, as he implores “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest” (<title rend="italic">KJV</title>). George Herbert’s <title rend="italic">The Temple</title> (1633) also gives similar religious invitations: “The Invitation,” for instance, uses a refrain to solicit “all” (sinners) to “Come … hither” at communion (Helen Wilcox, ed., <title rend="italic">The English Poems of George Herbert</title> [New York: Cambridge University Press, 2007], 625 n.1).</note></seg>, come and happy be;</rdg>

In <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="6">Universal Dissolution</ref>, Pulter refers to her son John as being her fifteenth child, although Eardley only finds records of fourteen, suggesting either the parish registers are incomplete, the other child was baptized elsewhere, or Pulter included a miscarriage. Pulter’s children, in order of death, were: Mary (d.1631); Hester (1630-2); William (1634-9); Charles (d. 1640); Elizabeth (1641-2); Jane (1625-45); Penelope (1633-55); James (1627-59); Edward (1638-65); Ann (1635-66); Mary (d. 1674); John (1648-77); Arthur (1636-80); Margaret (1629-86) (Alice Eardley, “An Edition of Lady Hester Pulter’s Book of ‘Emblemes’”. PhD diss., University of Warwick [2008], 41-42). This would therefore suggest this poem was written either after the death of Penelope in 1655, or James in 1659, depending on when the missing fifteenth child was born and died.</note></seg>,</rdg>

Pulter expands on her first emblem’s image of “mount[ing]” God’s throne via his direction, using Emblem 2 as a figurative and visual representation of the virtuous steps which will, as her didactic message insists, lead us to “glory”. See <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="67">Mighty Nimrod (Emblem 1)</ref> for a similar discussion of this theme; see also George Herbert’s poetry, which utilizes this trope of blessed steps and which possibly influenced not only Pulter’s thematic concerns, but the visualisation of the virtuous ladder via the marginal notations (see Headnote). Herbert’s <title rend="italic">The Temple</title> is organised in a tripartite structure: “The Church-porch”, “The Church”, and “The Church Militant”. The architectonic nature of the collection evokes the site of a spiritual temple (symbolising God) and the process of entering it via certain steps; Herbert’s God is “Thy bounteous Lord”, providing “choise of paths” to which “no by-wayes” should be taken (“The Church-porch”, lines 13-14).</note></seg> let us ascend</rdg>

While Aletheia is not directly referenced until line 21, this marginal notation suggests a fusion of classical mythology with Christian religion, as Pulter aligns “God’s word” with the truth characterised by the classical goddess. See <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="32">Aletheia’s Pearl</ref>, which gives an account of the speaker’s relationship with the personified figure of truth as Aletheia. In that poem, the speaker seeks to emphasise the fragility of truth, which she does via the metaphor of the pearl. See also Rachel Speght’s <title rend="italic">A Dreame</title>, which similarly contains a personified Truth (though not identified explicitly as Aletheia) as guide for the speaker, offering encouragement in her pursuit of education: “Take courage, and be constant in thy course, / Though irksome be the path, which thou must tread” (“Mortalities Memorandum, with a Dreame Prefixed”, in <title rend="italic">The Polemics and Poems of Rachel Speght</title>, ed. Barbara Kiefer Lewalski [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996], 55, lines 177-8). Elizabeth Melville is another female writer who invokes similar images of Christ as a guide leading the speaker of the poem up steps to heavenly truth: “On stately stepps, most stoutly I ascended. / Without his help I thought to enter there.” (<title rend="italic">A Godlie Dreame compiled by Elizabeth Melvill, Ladie Culros younger, at the request of a friend</title> [Edinburgh, 1620], stanza 30). Pulter hence draws on a popular didactic invocation of God, often embodied through the value of a personified Truth, as the only guide one needs through life.</note></seg>,</rdg>

Pulter also personifies a further five virtues: Humility, Patience, Chastity, Grace, and Truth. These virtues are listed in the left margin, which has the effect of giving a visual representation of the methodical steps one must follow, figuratively and literally, to reach heaven; see Headnote for further discussion.</note></seg> whose <seg>low-roofed<note type="critical">Pulter personifies “Humility” as being “low-roofed”, a conventional trope  which emphasises modesty and humbleness, in comparison to grand extravagance. Joseph Hall writes of the humble man as “a true Temple of God built with a low roofe” (<title rend="italic">Characters of Virtues and Vices</title> [1608], 31).This trope also appeared commonly in the country house poems of the 17th century; see Jonson’s <title rend="italic">To Penshurst</title>, which depicts Robert Sidney’s estate as “not … built to envious show” (Fowler, <title rend="italic">The Country House Poem</title> [Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1994], 53, line 1); see also Marvell’s <title rend="italic">Upon Appleton House</title> lines 1-72, which constructs Appleton House as a “sober frame” unlike those “columns … [which] so high be raised / To arch the brows that on them gazed” (Fowler 281. 1-8).</note></seg> <seg>temple<note type="critical"> note the four main biblical meanings of the word “temple”; (1) the site of Jewish worship in the Old Testament; (2) a symbol of Christ in the New Testament; (3) the Christian Church and God’s dwelling place in the New Testament; and (4) the human body, which itself becomes a temple (Helen Wilcox. <title rend="italic">The English Poems of George Herbert</title> [New York; Cambridge University Press, 2007], 39-40). Herbert’s <title rend="italic">The Temple</title> (1633) uses the site of the religious temple, or Church, as a metaphor for God, serving a similar purpose as Pulter does here.</note></seg> all did go</rdg>

Alice Eardley (2014) and Knight and Wall (Elemental Edition) have modernised the word to “ethnic”, referring to a non-Christian, non-Jewish person; a heathen (<title rend="italic">OED</title> 1). In her 2008 thesis, however, Eardley suggests that Pulter means “Hellenics”, which refers to Greek peoples during the period of Ancient Greece (“An Edition of Lady Hester Pulter’s Book of ‘Emblemes’”. PhD diss., University of Warwick [2008], 14 n. 10; <title rend="italic">OED</title> 1). This interpretation is interesting in comparison to the glossing of “God’s word” as the Greek goddess “Aletheia” in line 7, which would endorse Pulter’s notion that “Hellenics did …  know” of the principles such as “Humility” and “Honour” that are linked to God, and thus to Aletheia.</note></seg> this did know.</rdg>

          <rdg wit="#ae" rend="left-gutter-1">By these degrees we <seg>shall arise to glory<note type="critical">Pulter’s conclusion to this poem resonates with the conclusion of <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="67">Mighty Nimrod (Emblem 1)</ref>: “Then by his steps I’ll mount his glorious throne”. The change from first pronoun “I’ll” to second pronoun “we”, observes the role Pulter decides to take on as teacher and mediator, while also highlighting her children as the specific audience of her emblems. Hence, it serves to emphasizes the didactic message which the prefatory pair of emblems introduce, as the godly steps of virtue become an extended metaphor for the moral trajectory the collection of emblems embarks on.</note></seg>.</rdg>
