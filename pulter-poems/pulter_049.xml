                        The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers,
                        which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and
                        punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might
                        otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not
                        modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote
                        aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by
                        Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to
                        allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various
                        possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure
                        material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford
                        Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s
                        edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The
                        result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.

                      <p>My priority in editing these poems has been to modernise, and to achieve interpretative and visual clarity, in order to make the poems as accessible as possible to as wide a modern audience as is possible. Spelling is modernised, as is punctuation. Modernising the latter, in particular, often involves a significant act of editorial interpretation, but in my view this is one of the most productive areas of editorial intervention, particularly for a manuscript text such as Pulter’s where the punctuation is erratic compared to modern usage (and, indeed, compared to early modern printed texts).<seg>1<note type="critical">1.

                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">The model cheer and calm of strangled larks and sacrificial lambs are proffered as alternatives to the speaker’s restlessly throbbing heart and obstinately death-averse soul. As she does in other poems, Pulter writes to reprimand her soul for being afraid to die. Yet the poem’s opening rapid-fire interrogation mimics the very “unrest” it critiques. Similarly, the catalogue of creatures who coolly meet their fates is punctuated by disjunctions (“Yet … But … But”) which castigate the speaker. Only in the poem’s last lines are we released from this pattern of self-shaming, when the enjambment formally suggests, in an echo of the content, the greater scope of an afterlife unconfined by fleshly exemplars and our failures to live up to them.</note></rdg>
                <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">
                  <p>“My Heart Why Dost Thou Throb So in My Breast?” is one of Pulter’s brief devotional lyrics, in this case chastising her own heart and soul for their “sighs and sobs”, and comparing them to various creatures—the lark, the lamb, and the phoenix—who offer themselves up willingly for death. The “ail[ments]” and “unrest” of line 2 may be the generic woes that typically afflict the devotional speaker, who endures the earthly life, and who both longs for union with the divine and is unwilling to give up the human body. But the poem may also reflect more specifically on aging, as “thy sorrows with thy years increase” (line 8). The speaker “wouldst have the course of nature turn”, rather than offering herself up to the more sudden sacrifices of the lark, the lamb, and the phoenix. The lark, the lamb, and the phoenix all have associations with the praise of God or with Christ himself, willingly sacrificing themselves to death. Pulter’s use of these images owes much to the emblematic mode of thinking that is evident in the emblem poem series later in the manuscript.</p>
                    <p>Attempting to persuade the soul of the miraculous glory that would follow death, the concluding five lines rely on a cluster of images and words that recurs in Pulter’s devotional poetry: obliviation, calcination, and refinement. Her emphasis here is on the necessary calcination of the impure flesh, in death, and its “infinite” refinement, to achieve glory beyond. These lines are almost certainly indebted to George Herbert, who evokes a similar devotional concept in the opening stanza of “Easter”. Here, he describes the salvation of the believer made possible through Christ’s sacrifice: “as his death calcined thee to dust, / His life may make thee gold, and much more just” (lines 5-6). Herbert’s devotional lyrics are a clear influence on Pulter’s but in this poem, as is usual in the comparison between them, Pulter’s emphasis is more material and Herbert’s is more metaphorical and explicitly doctrinal.</p>

For a direct comparison to these final lines, see George Herbert, “Easter”: “as his death calcined thee to dust, / His life may make thee gold, and much more just” (lines 5-6). See also Pulter’s <ref target="/" corresp="63" type="pp-poem-ref">Dear God, from Thy High Throne Look Down</ref>, which uses a similar image: “Though grief calcine my flesh to dust” (line 4).</note><note type="textual">The manuscript reads “dropsie” in line 17, with the "p" obscured by an ink blot. I read this as a deliberate ink blot correcting an error, although “dropsie” would provide an alternative set of possible meanings: "dropsy” can mean “charged with water” (<title rend="italic">OED</title> B.b), and “calcine” can mean “dessicate” (<title rend="italic">OED</title> 1b). The Herbert allusion makes “drossy” a far preferable reading here, but the alternative set of meanings may contribute to the scribe’s apparent uncertainty.</note></seg></rdg>
