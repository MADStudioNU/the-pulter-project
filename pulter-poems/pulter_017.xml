                        The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers,
                        which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and
                        punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might
                        otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not
                        modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote
                        aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by
                        Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to
                        allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various
                        possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure
                        material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford
                        Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s
                        edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The
                        result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.

                    <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="editorialnote">With an undergraduate and graduate student audience in mind, this poem has been modernised in spelling and punctuation. Where modernisation would affect form, priority has been given to the integrity of the poem’s formal features (so, for instance, verb endings -est and -eth have been retained unmodernised; where the meter requires it, the verb ending -ed is accented, e.g., “Then shall thy blessèd influence”). Nouns have been capitalized only when there is clear personification. The notes provide information essential to understanding the poem, while the Headnote aims to stimulate readers’ own interpretations through suggesting literary or historical contexts, possible influences, comparable poems (by Pulter and by her predecessors and peers) and relevant critical arguments.</note></rdg>

            <app type="headnote">
                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">Where ideas of revolution sometimes inspire Pulter, here a metaphorical water cycle—with tears evaporating into cloudy sighs which, in turn, rain down again—is castigated for having “no end”: that is, it is both ceaseless and purposeless, since there’s “no ease” in sighs and tears that are “vain.” Yet she cannot stop: indeed, she diagnoses the vanity of tears in a line that is itself infused with a sigh (the interjected “ah me”). Although the speaker realizes she is caught in a vicious circle, she also determines that it is better not to succumb either to airy sighs or watery tears: instead, she must cycle between them until she attains her proper end in earthy “dust,” the element that signals her divine origin here, as in many of Pulter’s poems. Thus, the speaker’s initial portrayal of her all-too-human weakness—embodied in the mercurial weather of her emotional responses—is finally countered by her confident expression of trust in God and contentment that even his annihilation of her shall be to his glory.</note></rdg>
                <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">
                  <p>The first circle in this poem is the endless cycle of grief: “there is no end”. Yet Pulter finds an alternative vision in other kinds of cycle: spiritual, meteorological, alchemical. The speaker imagines her emotions and their physical manifestations climatically: her sighs become tears, and as the tears fall “in vain” they evaporate again and become sighs, just as air condenses into rain clouds and rain evaporates again. Pulter draws on the convention of using hyperbolic meteorological images for emotions, often influenced by Petrarch and also seen in, for instance, John Donne’s ’A Valediction forbidding mourning’  (see ‘Donne’s Circles’ in Curations for this poem). The turn to God at l. 15 breaks the cycle of grief while forging another cycle, that of the believer’s continuity with God: she was created by God and could even be annihilated by God. Pulter’s claim “Of nothing Thou didst me create” endorses God’s power in the face of major philosophical controversies over creation and matter which were also central to the poetry of Lucy Hutchinson and Margaret Cavendish (see ‘Matter and Creation’ in Curations for this poem for  Margaret Cavendish’s ’Nature Calls a Counsel, which is Motion, Figure, Matter, and Life, to Advise about Making the World’).</p>
                  <p>The phrase “crumble me to dust”, amongst many other images in Pulter’s poem, evokes George Herbert (see  ‘Dust and Devotional Lyric’ in Curations for this poem  for Herbert’s “Church Monuments”). In other poems by Pulter about transformation, similar ideas of of dissolution, condensation and dust take on a more specifically alchemical meaning (see Curations for this poem as well as <ref target="/" corresp="21" type="pp-poem-ref">The Circle [2]</ref> and <ref target="/" corresp="65" type="pp-poem-ref">The Hope</ref>). The closing rhyme of story / glory creates a counterweight to the despair in human agency. The suggestion of Pulter’s “story”, in the sense of the poem itself as well as her life narrative, mitigates some of the willing self-abasement of the poem. This poem also appears in <title rend="italic">Women Poets of the English Civil War</title>, ed. Sarah C.E. Ross and Elizabeth Scott-Baumann. While I have modernised here, as in that edition, I have chosen to punctuate slightly differently, demonstrating some of the effects of editorial decisions on tone and meaning. In <title rend="italic">Women Poets of the English Civil War</title>, Ross and I ended line 8 with a period and line 21 with a comma, while here I have experimented with slightly more open punctuation at these line endings, playing out the poem’s themes of cyclical and ongoing movement.</p>
