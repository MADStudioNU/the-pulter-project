                        The aim of the elemental edition to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers,
                        which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and
                        punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might
                        otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not
                        modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote
                        aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by
                        Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to
                        allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various
                        possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure
                        material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford
                        Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s
                        edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The
                        result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.

The retention of original spelling and punctuation has the potential to get us closer to the choices made by the poet and scribe, but some scribal details (such as abbreviations) do not seem substantive or meaning-bearing and run the risk of alienating a modern reader.</note></rdg>

The poem offers a heartfelt but still humorous challenge to the ne’er-do-well husbands targeted by its final line, since the gap invoked between rattish harmony and human discord must invite embarrassed laughter: if rats can manage, why can’t we? But the cozy harvest-home portrait of the animals’ den finds no parallel symbiosis in the human realm, where the choice made by “most” husbands is between roaming public houses of ill-repute (leaving a pleasureless, care-filled domesticity to their wives) and infesting private homes with their tyranny. As well as contrasting the human and non-human—not to our advantage—the poem quietly critiques the greater pleasures of the hard-working rural rats with “wealthy” couples who fail to appropriately enjoy their wealth, including each other.</note></rdg>
                    <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">This emblem contemplates the marmot as a symbol of marital harmony. Pulter begins her poem by referring to Pliny’s description of the marmot piling grass and herbs on its mate’s belly and then drawing it by the tail into their den. She contrasts that image of shared wealth with human husbands who either neglect or subjugate their wives.</note></rdg>

Marmottanes, which are as bigge as Brocks or Badgers, keepe in, during winter: but they are prouided of victuals before hand which they gather together and carry into their holes.

                    <rdg wit="#ae">But most to Taverns or to Wors will <seg>Rome<note type="critical">Pulter’s disparagement of husbands who roam to taverns or worse (presumably brothels) echoes <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="85">This Poor Turtledove (Emblem 20)</ref> in which she criticizes husbands who follow a dissolute path. She writes, “Then if your Husbands Rant it high and Game” (line 23), but in that poem she urges wives to avoid following their spouses’ bad example: “Besure you Double not their Guilt and shame” (line 24). In that poem, Pulter advises wives, rather than husbands, not to “Roame … to plays and Taverns” (lines 32–34). She suggests that wives should “Chastly live and Rather Spend yo<hi rend="italic">u</hi>r dayes / In Setting Forth Your great Creator’s praise” and even to write “harmles Rimes” as she does (lines 42–45; my transcriptions from the manuscript). Her interest in this emblem on the marmots is to focus on the couple and the domestic happiness they can enjoy. Interestingly, in his discussion of the marmot (which he calls the alpine mouse), Edward Topsell depicts little marital cooperation between the male and female (<title rend="italic">The historie of foure-footed beastes</title> [1607], p. 525; with thanks to one of this edition’s anonymous reviewers for this reference): “Now the female in this kind is crafty, and more apt to deuoure; the male on the other side more thirsty and sparing, wherefore he driueth his female out of the den in the winter time, and stopeth the mouth of his caue, to forbid hir entrance, but she getteth behind the same, and diggeth a secret hole, whilest the male lyeth at the mouth asleepe, she consumeth the whole store behind him, wherefore in the spring time she commeth forth very fat and comely, and he very leane. And therefore in my opinion, the makers of Emblems may very well discribe an vnthrifty wise [i.e., wife], that consumeth her husbands wealth, by the picture of this female.”</note></seg></rdg>

                    <rdg wit="#ae">Or elce they’l alwais <seg>Tirannise<note type="critical">The language of tyranny in the context of relations between husbands and wives is used by many women writers of the seventeenth century. While most writers acknowledge the authority of Adam over Eve, particularly post-Fall, they often object to an abuse of that power. Aemilia Lanyer, in <title rend="italic">Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum</title> (1611), lines 825–830, addresses contemporary men with the bold request, “Then let us have our Libertie againe, / And challendge to your selves no Sov’raigntie;[…] Your fault beeing greater, why should you disdaine / Our beeing your equals, free from tyranny?” (<title rend="italic">The Poems of Aemilia Lanyer: Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum</title>, edited by Susanne Woods, Oxford University Press, 1993, p. 87). The fault to which Lanyer is referring is that of Pilate ordering the crucifixion of Christ, which Lanyer argues has tainted all men by association, just as Eve eating the apple has tainted all women. In a tract of 1649 called <title rend="italic">A vision: wherein is manifested the disease and cure of the kingdome</title> (which argues against King Charles’s execution), Elizabeth Poole uses metaphors comparing the king and his subjects to a tyrannical husband and his suffering wife. Poole writes, “For he is the Father and husband of your bodyes, as unto men, and therefore your right cannot be without him …. Onely consider, that as she [i.e., Abigail, the virtuous wife of cruel Nabal] lifted not her hand against her husband to take his life, no more doe yee against yours …. For know this, the Conquest was not without divine displeasure, whereby Kings came to reigne, though through lust they tyranized: which God excuseth not, but judgeth; and his judgements are fallen heavy, as you see, upon <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi> your Lord” (pp. 4–5; with thanks to one of this edition’s anonymous reviewers for the Poole reference). In a digression on the implications of Eve’s punishment that her desire shall be for her husband (Genesis 3:16), Lucy Hutchinson discusses the way that wives choose the shackles of marriage out of love for their husbands. In <title rend="italic">Order and Disorder</title> (1679), canto 5, lines 139–143, she writes, “Now though they easier under wise rule prove, / And every burden is made light by love, / Yet golden fetters, soft-lined yokes, still be / Though gentler curbs, but curbs of liberty, / As well as the harsh tyrant’s iron yoke” (Lucy Hutchinson, <title rend="italic">Order and Disorder</title>, edited by David Norbrook, Blackwell, 2001, p. 69).</note></seg> at home</rdg>
