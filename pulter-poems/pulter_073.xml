            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

            <note type="editorialnote">Our priority in editing these poems has been to modernise, and to achieve interpretative and visual clarity, in order to make the poems as accessible as possible to as wide a modern audience as is possible. Spelling is modernised, as is punctuation. Modernising the latter, in particular, often involves a significant act of editorial interpretation, but in our view this is one of the most productive areas of editorial intervention, particularly for a manuscript text such as Pulter’s where the punctuation is erratic compared to modern usage (and, indeed, compared to early modern printed texts). <seg>1<note>1.

              <note type="headnote">What can we learn from the parenting habits of moose, apes, and eagles? Pulter proffers two lessons from the fauna whose examples she assembles here. The first is that we should show all our children “equal love”: the alternative is to spoil favorites, possibly to death, and neglect others so badly that they degenerate. This is the speaker’s lesson, which she points exclusively toward herself by poem’s end, as if it’s a principle she has trouble practicing. But mid-poem, her attention strays to the salutary way in which the moose (like human exemplars, biblical and mercantile) never puts her eggs in one basket but distributes her offspring widely so they cannot all be attacked at once. This pragmatic lesson has little to do with the high-minded invocation of equitable love: why are they in the same poem? So much is not clear; however, more than one of Pulter’s poems alludes to her far-flung daughters and her desire to bring them home. Perhaps the moose’s example made their distance seem more strategic, and thus more bearable; while the invocation to love all her offspring equally countered an impulse to do otherwise.</note>
          </rdg>
          <rdg wit="#ae">
              <note type="headnote"><p>Pulter’s focus in this poem is on parental love and the equal “manifest[ation]” of this to one's children (line 16). She draws on William Wood’s depiction of the Indian moose in his <title rend="italic">New England’s Prospect</title>, commending the animal’s equal division of “comforts” and “care” between her “three young” offspring ([1635], 16-19, esp. 18; lines 1-2). Utilising the moose as her predominant emblem in the poem, Pulter proceeds to compare the moose’s parental strategies with those of other animals, including the ape and the eagle, beasts that she criticises for their unequal division of affection between their young. Engaging in the discourses of Wood, Pliny, and Aesop, this emblem is indicative of the ways in which Pulter's emblems draw on esteemed literary, philosophical, and classical texts for her own didactic purposes.</p>
                  <p>Pulter’s message of equal love develops and modifies slightly at line seven of the poem, as she emphasises the more strategic aspects of the “policy” by which the moose distributes her children as an act of preservation (line 7). Pulter salutes this unbiased act of separation as she observes the way that parenthood is at the mercy of chance. Several of her occasional lyrics indicate Pulter’s own struggle as mother of children who lived elsewhere, suggesting that Pulter champions the moose as an example of parental sacrifice; see <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="2">The Invitation into the Country</ref> and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="38">To My Dear Jane, Margaret, and Penelope Pulter, They Being at London, I at Broadfield</ref> for examples of Pulter’s occasional lyrics addressing her separation from her children. Her own experience of maternal loss—13 of her 15 children having pre-deceased her—must also have made her particularly sensitive to the devastating role chance could play in parenting.</p>
                  <p>The poem itself acts as an instructive emblem aimed at parents, a divergence from the audience of children often addressed in her emblem collection; see, for instance, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="68">Come, My Dear Children (Emblem 2)</ref> and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="101">Doves and Pearls (Emblem 36)</ref>. “The Indian Moose” therefore illustrates the multiple layers of moral address Pulter achieves throughout her emblem collection. Pulter directly acknowledges her intended audience in line 15, stating “Let parents learn by what is writ above”. This imperative appears similarly in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="71">The Manucodiats (Emblem 5)</ref>, which evokes the emblem of  manucodiats—birds-of-paradise—as “transcend[ent]” examples of parental love; here, Pulter employs a similar command, stating “Let parents then learn here indulgency” (lines 10, 16).</p>
                  <p>Despite her instruction to parents, the final line of Emblem 7 takes a “psalmic” turn inward, as Pulter appeals (indirectly) to God, desiring her own edification as a good protestant mother (Rachel Dunn [Zhang], “Breaking a Tradition: Hester Pulter and the English Emblem Book”, <title rend="italic">The Seventeenth Century</title>, 30.1 [2015], 55-73, 64). This is a significant feature of Pulter’s emblem collection as she often begins by providing a description of the emblem, followed by an explication of the moral, and then a conclusion of self-reflection, as characterised by an inward turn, to reflect upon her own mortal position as a virtuous protestant mother, wife, and royalist. For more on this aspect of Pulter’s emblem collection and a clear example, see <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="67">Mighty Nimrod (Emblem 1)</ref>, esp. note to line 21 of our Amplified Edition.</p>

Wood writes of moose that “They have generally three at a time, which they hide a mile from another, giving them sucke by turnes; thus they doe, that if the Woolfe should finde one, he might misse of the other” (<bibl><title rend="italic">New England’s Prospect</title> [1635], 16-19, esp. 18</bibl>). See also <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="92">The Stately Moose (Emblem 27)</ref> for another description of the moose by Pulter, as she again draws on Wood’s description of the animal to highlight God as the only constant within the “frail” and “casual” aspects of life (line 39).</note></seg></rdg>

To escape Esau’s murderous jealousy, Jacob flees to Harran where he creates his own family. On their return to his homeland of Canaan where Esau is leader, and upon hearing his brother is approaching with an army of four hundred, Jacob divides his children between his two wives and handmaids, hoping that if Esau attacks one group, the others will be saved; see Gen. 33. Pulter draws parallels between this biblical narrative and Wood’s account of the Indian moose, demonstrating how both use a similar strategy of dividing their children into groups in the hope that not all will be attacked. Pulter’s approval of the practice of separating children may also have had royalist implications: the plot to remove Charles’s younger brother James to France in April 1648 was crucial to the survival of the royal family (<bibl>W. A. Speck. “James II and VII.” <title rend="italic">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</title> [2004</bibl>]).</note></seg></rdg>

Pulter compares the strategies of merchants to those of good parents who do not place all their worth in one child.</note></seg>.</rdg>
