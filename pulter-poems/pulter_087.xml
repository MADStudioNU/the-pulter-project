For example, what according to modern usage is incorrect subject/verb agreement might have been deemed acceptable to a seventeenth-century scribe or compositor. All such instances are treated instead using the ORIG and REG tags. (See below.)</p>
          <p>Corrections and annotations made within the scope of the original document either by its original authors, owners, and/or transcribers are noted using ADD tags.

            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

              <note type="editorialnote">In my editions, I prioritize accessibility and multiple interpretive possibilities. To prepare these poems for a wide range of readers, I have modernized erratic early modern spelling, punctuation, and capitalization to conform to standard American usage. I gloss archaic definitions and confusing syntax, and I expand contractions, unless needed to maintain the integrity of the poem’s form. My notes investigate how Pulter’s poems engage with the literature and culture of mid-seventeenth-century England. At the same time, I emphasize how her poems are unique, how they respond to one another and seem to reveal their author’s individual circumstances and philosophies. It is worth noting that although Pulter’s poems survive in only one known source, they are not necessarily stable texts. The source manuscript features variants and revisions that invite multiple interpretations. I encourage readers to refer to the manuscript transcriptions and images on this site; my notes alert readers when the manuscript’s original spelling or physical features are especially worth considering.</note>

            <note type="headnote">Karl Marx concluded that “Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.”<seg>1<note type="critical">Karl Marx, “<ref target="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm" type="new-window-url">A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right Introduction,</ref>” 1844.</note></seg> Two centuries earlier, Pulter also shockingly imagined  her deity as a drug for oppressed creatures, much like the herbal medicine used by the deer in this emblem. Chased by hounds and arrow-wounded, such a creature is also found in “Upon the Death of my Dear and Lovely Daughter, Jane Pulter” (Poem 10): but where the deer there dies, the hart in this poem eventually discovers dittany, a healing plant. This hart, skilled in herbalism, is so successful in self-medicating as to outrun all pursuers and attain a life that sounds, paradoxically, as restful as death itself, where in “sweet shades [she] doth rest in peace.” Such a restful death-in-life, or life-in-death, is also the goal of the soul, tenor to the deer’s vehicle: just as terrified, dogged by spiritual enemies, heart-broken, sighing, weeping, all but exhausted and indeed “dissolved”—when the soul finds her own, perhaps more enduring and saving, cure. The speaker concludes by asking God to “let me trust in Thee,” since her ordeal is not only to outpace foes but simply to believe in the efficacy of this legendary ancient medicine.</note>
          </rdg>
          <rdg wit="#ae">
              <note type="headnote">In this poem, Pulter compares a wounded hart to a grieving soul. Like a deer nearing death who is restored by a medicinal plant, a pained soul can turn to Christ for comfort and peace. This emblem functions as a prayer or meditation; the speaker assures herself that her pain will end eventually if she trusts in God. At the same time, the poem does not minimize the pain of grief, as its suffering deer and emotionally exhausted speaker move frantically through a cruel, oppressive world. Although a hart is a male deer, Pulter assigns it and the soul feminine pronouns. A feminized “hunted hart” also appears in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="9">Like Lily Leaves</ref>, in which Pulter compares an arrow-struck deer to her dying daughter Jane, and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="90">This Flying Fish (Emblem 25)</ref>, which uses the same image as an analogy for the death of King Charles I. When considered alongside those poems, this emblem’s surviving hart seems to indulge a fantasy of a magic balm able to prevent such losses or heal a broken heart. It also draws attention to Pulter’s medical knowledge. Many early modern women served as medical caregivers in their households and learned about healing plants by reading books on herbalism.</note>
