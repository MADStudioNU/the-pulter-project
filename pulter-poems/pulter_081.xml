All such instances are treated instead using the ORIG and REG tags. (See below.)</p>
          <p>Corrections and annotations made within the scope of the original document either by its original authors, owners, and/or transcribers are noted using ADD tags.

            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

            <note type="editorialnote">In my editions, I prioritize accessibility and multiple interpretive possibilities. To prepare these poems for a wide range of readers, I have modernized erratic early modern spelling, punctuation, and capitalization to conform to standard American usage. I gloss archaic definitions and confusing syntax, and I expand contractions, unless needed to maintain the integrity of the poem’s form. My notes investigate how Pulter’s poems engage with the literature and culture of mid-seventeenth-century England. When citing the Bible, I use the King James Version. It is worth noting that although Pulter’s poems survive in only one known source, they are not necessarily stable texts. Their manuscript features variants and revisions that invite multiple interpretations. I encourage readers to refer to the manuscript transcriptions and images on this site; my notes alert readers when the manuscript’s original spelling or physical features are especially worth considering.</note>

              <note type="headnote">What makes a tiger like a lark? And each like a flying fish? In Pulter’s riddling emblem, the (rather surprising) answer is their pride and their undoing by it. In this, though, the tiger, lark, and flying fish are no worse than a long list of fallen biblical bigwigs, which the poem rapidly inventories. Pulter’s poetic claims here are, unusually, bolstered in many cases by marginal references to chapter and verse, in what appears to be her own hand: her facility as a Bible reader—perhaps even her pride in that skill—is clearly on display. The fact that she gets one reference wrong might be the exception that proves the rule that pride goeth before a fall.</note>

          <rdg wit="#ae">
            <note type="headnote">This poem, which is only briefly about a tiger, warns readers not to commit the deadly sin of pride. Pulter’s tiger is cruel not because she is a savage predator, but because she is a Petrarchan mistress who scorns suitors and haughtily admires her own beauty. “The Cruel Tiger” is part of a section in Pulter’s manuscript titled “Emblems,” poems that typically combine symbolic pictures with text to create pithy moral messages. However, Pulter did not include illustrations with her emblems, and this absence is especially striking for a poem about vain creatures infatuated with their own images. Pulter’s poem adapts a familiar fable about a hunter distracting a mother tiger from her whelps using a glass ball. Although obsessive self-gazing might recall Narcissus, the beautiful young man in Greek mythology who fell in love with his own reflection, Pulter’s emblem instead focuses on the natural world and “sacred stories”: female animals and male monarchs who exemplify the dangers of pride. Female tigers were thought to be fiercely maternal in early modern literature. Although many of Pulter’s poems are concerned with parenting and maternity, Pulter chose not to highlight that aspect of the tiger in this poem. In her manuscript, Pulter annotated the poem in her own hand, citing a series of Biblical verses about male monarchs whose arrogant actions threaten their future. This poem allows us to see Pulter’s interpretation of these parables as well as her self-representation as a pious, learned poet who cites her sources.</note>
