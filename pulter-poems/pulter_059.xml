                        The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers,
                        which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and
                        punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might
                        otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not
                        modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote
                        aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by
                        Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to
                        allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various
                        possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure
                        material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford
                        Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s
                        edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The
                        result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.

                    <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="editorialnote">My “amplified” editions seek to make the poems as accessible as possible by modernizing spelling and punctuation and providing only brief definitions for words, while discursive notes and the materials I gather for the “curations” section place Pulter’s poems into conversations. As I build the curations for a given poem—provisional and quirky as they are—I keep returning to the poem, re-reading, rethinking, and adding layers to the notes. I hope to show that Pulter was intellectually and politically embedded rather than isolated, taking up issues, genres, and tropes that also interested her contemporaries and that sometimes accrue unpredictable salience in later periods. Rather than focusing only on possible sources or influences, I cast a wide net both within the seventeenth century and outside it, trying to catch cultural materials Pulter might have engaged, some she excludes or ignores, and even some she probably could never have imagined. Curations don’t precede the poems nor are they implied by the poems—as if the poem gathers them to itself (although it can sometimes feel that way) or hales them forth. Instead, as a curator I weave the poem into a web of relations, seeking to open out rather than close down interpretive possibilities. This extends to including extracts that are long enough that readers might find things therein that I do not anticipate. I also look for a multi-vectored traffic among Pulter’s poetry and the other materials. What might the materials I’ve gathered help readers see in the poems—or notice is not there? But also, how do the poems bring fresh perspectives into the conversations into which I draw them? The more one reads the poems as participants in wider ranging conversations, the more fascinatingly twisty Pulter appears. Often, I don’t grasp how she upends or comes at conventions aslant until I have mucked about composting my “curations.”</note></rdg>

                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">This poem is unusual for Pulter in both form and content: written in a bouncing iambic trimeter, with frequent feminine rhymes (a formal quality not irrelevant to the content), it features a proposition in the title which is promptly queried in the text. The speaker skeptically or sneeringly questions whether the interlocutor’s beloved is indeed “so wondrous fair”—which of course unfairly exaggerates the lover’s actual claim. What follows is an interrogatory blazon alluding to specific body parts, among other outstanding qualities, of various divinities. These questions are asked, as though in a dramatic monologue, to determine if the beloved’s measurements measure up to this high standard. The quizzed suitor appears to respond in the affirmative, so the speaker urges him to start wooing. While the allusion to Aurora is highly Pulterian, the poem’s eroticized bodily detail and courtship advice are unusual in her works (although, also on courtship, see <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="112">“The Turtle and his Paramour” [Emblem 47]</ref>).</note></rdg>
                <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote"><p>This poem is organized around questions and its title raises one for the reader: whose love is fair? The whole poem is in the second person, in which the speaker interrogates an interlocutor about “thy” love and then, finally satisfied that she is so wondrous that she exceeds every precedent, urges him to woo her. Here the speaker acts as a kind of wing man to the lover, playing something like the role Diana O’Hara identifies as the “go-between.” These go-betweens served as “movers,” “suitors,” “speakers,” and “brokers” of marriage in Tudor courtships as depicted on the stage and in church court depositions (Diana O’Hara, <title rend="italic">Courtship and Constraint: Rethinking the Making of Marriage in Tudor England</title> [Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, 2000], pp. 99-121). The blazon tradition always installs a third party, the addressee to whom the speaker “blazons” or trumpets the virtues of his beloved, both announcing possession of her and seeming to advertise her (Nancy J. Vickers, “‘The blazon of sweet beauty’s best’: Shakespeare’s <title rend="italic">Lucrece</title>,” in <title rend="italic">Shakespeare and the Question of Theory</title>, ed. Patricia Parker and Geoffrey Harman [Methuen, 1985], pp. 95-115). Pulter’s speaker here is that third party, pointing out the beloved’s virtues to the apparently reluctant suitor. This dynamic is unusual in poetry. We can easily find triangulation in love poetry: in many poems, male speakers address their rivals or warn other men against women in general or in particular; in Aphra Behn’s “Invitation,” the female speaker steps between one Damon and a “cruel shepherdess,” in the hopes of taking her place as his beloved. Shakespeare writes sonnets urging the young man to procreate, but they focus on the beauty of the young man, which should leave a record, and on the offspring, rather than the prospective wife. While these are all triangles (and you can see some of them under <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Triangulation and the Second Person</ref> in the Curations for this poem) they all work differently than does Pulter’s triangle in this poem, in which a speaker advises the addressee to pursue a woman pronto. We find something like this dynamic more often in the drama, as Beatrice and Benedick’s friends push them together in <title rend="italic">Much Ado About Nothing</title>, or Cesario urges Orsino not to flag in his pursuit of Olivia in <title rend="italic">Twelfth Night</title>. The poem also treats the temporal urgency central to seduction poems in a novel way. In most <foreign rend="italic">carpe diem</foreign> seduction poems, male speakers threaten women with time’s ravages, urging them to surrender to wooing posthaste; here the speaker works to motivate an apparently hesitant lover, arguing that the beloved’s fairness warrants urgent pursuit.</p><p>The speaker’s close attention to another’s beloved blurs the distinction between mine and thine. Pulter’s dialogic poems can often be read as dialogues within the self. Might the two parties here also be sides of the same person? The speaker’s careful inventory of female beauty links this poem—which seems in many ways impersonal—to Pulter’s blazons of her dead daughter (<ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="11">Tell Me No More [On the Same]</ref>) and of her own body (<ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="51">Made When I Was Not Well</ref>). When Pulter describes a human body in detail, she focuses on the female body. Whereas the blazon has often been understood as a “divide and conquer” strategy, by which a male speaker dissects and masters a female beloved, Pulter suggests the blazon’s possibilities for turning the female gaze on the female body. She uses the blazon’s conventions to capture her memory of her daughter, her memory of her own young flesh, her frank appraisal of her aging body, and even, in this highly stylized poem, her appreciation of what wondrous fairness in a woman might look, smell, and sound like as well as the ridiculous standards women have to meet before men feel motivated to woo. The dense tissue of allusion should not distract from the keen observation it accompanies. Read in relation to Pulter’s other poetry, the absence of religion is striking here, as are its consequences for the poem’s teleology. The insistent interrogation builds toward persuading the lover to ride off a-wooing—giddyup!—not, as so often in Pulter, to die and rise again. Within its secular arc, the poem ends with a beginning, wooing rather than marriage.</p></note></rdg>

Rejecting the offering, the other gods reassembled and resurrected Pelops, replacing the eaten shoulder with an ivory one (Ovid, <title rend="italic">Metamorphoses</title>, Book 6). Pulter’s allusion here describes the beloved’s shoulder as ivory, linking it to the image of Galatea, Pygmalion’s “lass,” the statue with whom he fell in love. Both these references to ivory racialize the beloved, emphasizing her whiteness.

Her “coyness” may refer to this reluctance to marry, which Neptune overcame by sending a dolphin to persuade or seize her. The dolphin, then, played a role similar to that of the speaker of Pulter’s poem, facilitating courtship. The reference to coy Amphitrite here sets up the reference to Philanthropos in the next line.</p>
                      <p>In the references to Saturnian issue, Aphrodite, and Amphitrite, Pulter may be sending up the strategy of comparison she employs here, piling up allusions to goddesses rather than human women.

A dolphin was said either to have negotiated with Amphitrite on Poseidon’s behalf (see previous line) or to have abducted her so that Poseidon might marry her (<ref target="//www.theoi.com/Ther/Delphin.html"><title rend="italic">The Theoi Project</title></ref>).</note></seg>,</rdg>

                      <p>This name means lover of mankind. It was also a “standard epithet” for the dolphin, which was depicted from antiquity on as loving humans (especially men and boys) and their music, and providing them with speedy transit and even rescue. “The stories of the dolphin as ‘philanthropos’ occur not merely in folklore and in minor, undiscriminating authors, but in the most authoritative and reputable of the ancients” (John Creaser, “Dolphins in <title rend="italic">Lycidas</title>,” <title rend="italic">Review of English Studies</title> 36.142 [1985]: pp. 235-43, esp. p. 238).</p>
                      <p>The dolphin is often depicted in visual art and in literature as ridden by humans or as transporting humans. Cupid or Eros and Apollo were often depicted astride a dolphin, as was the ancient Greek poet Arion, whom, according to legend, dolphins rescued when he leaped into the sea to avoid being murdered by pirates. One romance uses the same verb Pulter does here (bestride) to describe Arion: “Upon the trembling billows was descry’d / Arion with a golden Harpe in’s hand, / Who a huge crooked Dolphine did bestride / And in the dancing waves did bravely ride” (Francis Kinnaston, <title rend="italic">Leoline and Sydanis</title> [London, 1642], sig. K2v). This vision of Arion links making music with riding the dolphin. In Shakespeare’s <title rend="italic">A Midsummer Night’s Dream</title>, Oberon similarly links the two, remembering hearing “a mermaid on a dolphin’s back / Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath / That the rude sea grew civil at her song / And certain stars shot madly from their spheres / To hear the sea-maid’s music” (<title rend="italic">A Midsummer Night’s Dream</title>, 2.1.150-54). In Shakespeare’s <title rend="italic">Twelfth Night</title>, a dolphin helps to rescue the shipwrecked Sebastian, who, the Captain reassures Viola, bound himself “to a strong mast, that lived upon the sea, / Where like Arion on the dolphin’s back, / I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves” (TN 1.2). Both of these quotations are from the third edition of the Norton Shakespeare (2016). In Milton’s “Lycidas,” too, the poet calls on “ye Dolphins” to “waft the hapless youth” (line 164), that is, the drowned friend the poem commemorates, apparently drawing on these associations of the dolphin with rescue and perhaps even with the transport of the dead for burial or the soul for salvation (see Creaser). In urging the lover to hop on a dolphin to pursue his beloved, Pulter reinforces the link between the musical fair one and Amphitrite, draws on all of these traditions of dolphins assisting humans (especially men)—and suggests that the fair beloved lies across the sea or in the realm of myth.</p>
