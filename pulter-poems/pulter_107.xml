            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>
          <rdg wit="#ae">
              <note type="editorialnote">This edition modernizes the spelling and punctuation of Pulter’s text in order to make it accessible to a broad readership. I consulted Alice Eardley’s edition of the poem, although my editorial decisions vary significantly from hers (cited as <seg>“Eardley”<note type="gloss"><title rend="italic">Poems, Emblems, and The Unfortunate Florinda</title> (Iter Inc., Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies, 2014), pp. 245–6.</note></seg> in this edition). Research on Indigenous whaling practices is hindered by the fact that there are few surviving accounts of whaling in the Americas dating from the seventeenth century and they are authored by European writers who were often at several removes from their reported sources. The term “Indian” features prominently in the poem and the historical texts included in my Curations (<ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Did hunters really ride whales like horses?</ref>, <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">The Leviathan and the Bible</ref>, <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">The Miracle of the Swine</ref>, <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Taming the North American “Indian”</ref>, <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Whales Working in Mills</ref>, <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Whaling Legends</ref>). The poem seems to be based on a Spanish explorer’s account of a whale hunt by the Tequesta, a tribe that inhabited the southeastern coast of Florida until the mid-eighteenth century (see the Curation <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Whaling Legends</ref> for further discussion of Pulter’s source material). But Pulter’s subject is the archetypal uncivilized Indian, a fictional character with no relation to the Tequesta. In my notes I have opted to use the descriptor “Indigenous,” with the acknowledgement that this label is also an invention of European colonizers that fails to capture the diversity of the native peoples and cultures existing in America.</note>

            <note type="headnote">What starts as a lesson in not underestimating a seemingly less powerful foe takes a dramatic turn in this emblem, which becomes a meditation on the unexpected consequences of riding animals: whales, Hydra-like horses, and demonically possessed pigs. Pulter first draws on traveler’s tales to describe the way that Native Americans use their intelligence to overpower and devour whales: after cramming poles up their nostrils, they allegedly ride the whales until they tire and beach themselves. After summing up this fable’s moral—that brains can overcome brawn—the narrator reverses both the rider’s fate and the moral by imagining Oliver Cromwell figuratively riding an unruly populace. Unable to control the beast (as Native Americans so ably could), Cromwell is heading to a tragic end that Pulter aligns with the devil driving animals into eternal damnation; turning from horses to swine, Pulter imagines the fate of the nation by recounting the story of Jesus transferring demons from a person into pigs, who then drowned themselves in the ocean. In this unusual emblem, the moral shifts: a warning against pride in brawn in favor of brains converts into a plea to shake off the devil. Humans perhaps only seem superior when we subdue other creatures: we too are vulnerable to being “ridden” by forces beyond our control.</note>
          </rdg>
          <rdg wit="#ae">
              <note type="headnote">This is the second of two emblems Pulter wrote about the leviathan, a sea monster in the Bible that is typically identified with the whale (see also <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="78">This Vast Leviathan (Emblem 12)</ref>). The poem is a striking depiction of a whale hunt in which a so-called “Indian” man rides a whale like a horse and kills it by driving wooden stakes into its blowholes. The story can be traced back to Spanish travel narratives of the late sixteenth century, with the hunt supposedly witnessed firsthand by an explorer in Florida. My objective is to offer readers a postcolonial presentation of the text, one that questions European representations of Indigenous peoples. The archival challenges to creating a postcolonial reading are discussed in the Editorial Note. The poem and the texts included in my Curations for this poem illustrate how Indigenous peoples and their ways of life reached the status of myth in Europe by way of explorer publications. This emblem can fruitfully be viewed in the context of early modern literature about North America, in which Christian theology was intertwined with an imperialist agenda. Pulter injects the tale of the whale hunt with allusions to classical mythology and Bible stories. In her hands it becomes fable-like, with the symbolism of the emblem operating on multiple levels; what begins as a classic battle of strength versus wit turns into a warning about the Devil on a sinner’s back. Pulter aligns her English readers with the whale and the Indigenous hunter with the Devil, suggesting that there is also a contest for dominance between European and Indigenous American peoples. Central to the poem is the theme of taming—the danger of being mastered by demonic forces or peoples and the need to bring Indigenous populations under Christian European rule.</note>
