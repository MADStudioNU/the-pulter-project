Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

The poem in iambic pentameter couplets appeared as a single stanza, which I divided to highlight the unusually bold break in the argument and, at the same time, to underscore the performance of the poet and the restoration of order and truth over the confusion resulting from the civil wars, regicide, and divine judgement described in the poem’s first half.<seg>[3]<note type="critical">3. By introducing this division, I forge formal connections between Poem 64 and Geffrey Whitney’s two-part emblem “Veritas temporis filia” <bibl>(Whitney, <title rend="italic">A Choice of Emblemes, and Other Devises</title> [Leiden, 1586], 4)</bibl>.

              <note type="headnote">This poem begins <foreign rend="italic">in medias res</foreign>: mid-sentence (“And”), and apparently in the midst of England’s civil wars, but sometime after the beheading of Charles I in 1649. In her opening query, the speaker seems to regret the inevitability of violence (“the sword”) as a solution to her country’s misrule, yet she still invokes divine vengeance upon her foes. Although she appears to implore God to condemn <hi rend="italic">all</hi> factions, Pulter evidently excluded her own party from this condemnation: factions were dissidents; royalists were loyalists. The invocation of the “Lord of Hosts,” an epithet from the Hebrew Bible, suits the eye-for-an-eye endgame envisioned here: if the speaker has her way, the bloodthirsty shall be quenched by each other’s blood, and as they were mercilessly deaf to the cries of the innocent, so God shall be to theirs, at the end of their earthly lives or (implicitly) in a hellish hereafter. The speaker then prays for the eternal salvation of those she considers God’s chosen, and for the restoration at the end of time of their slain king: not, in this context, Christ, but Charles I (although the two were often identified in royalist imagery). As though to usher in this future peace (for some, anyhow), the concluding hortatory anaphora (“Let … Let”) and personified abstractions (time, grace, truth) evoke a serenity utterly at odds with the bloody clashes earlier in the poem.</note>

            <note type="headnote">
                <p>This lyrical poem resonates with Pulter’s three elegies on Charles I, which were influenced by the culture and aesthetics of kingship and martyrdom in the wake of the regicide (1649). In an age before political parties, royalism—which is on full display in Pulter’s poetry—emerged as a political, cultural, and literary phenomenon that resisted Cromwellian rule while upholding monarchical authority. Composed c. 1651, “And Must the Sword this Controverse Decide” reflects on the British civil wars, the ongoing political and civil disputes, and on the persistence of royalist sentiment and the value of literary production well after the regicide, implied by the reference to the king’s death, which “hath been deplored / So long by us.”</p>
                <p>The tone of Pulter’s royalist verse is serious, and not reflective of the Anacreontic mid seventeenth-century literary mode, which emerged in the experience of royalist defeat, and which represents one branch of the heterogeneous Cavalier poetic tradition. Anacreon, the ancient Greek poet known for his drinking lyrics, was the inspiration for the witty, masculinist verse of some English Cavalier lyricists.<seg>[1]<note type="gloss"><bibl>Karen Britland, “Conspiring with ‘friends’: Hester Pulter’s Poetry and the Stanley Family at Cumberlow Green,” <title rend="italic">The Review of English Studies</title>, NS, 69.292 (2018): 846-49 (832–54).</bibl></note></seg> Unsurprisingly, neither Pulter nor her like-minded (female) contemporaries, notably Margaret Cavendish and Katherine Philips, indulge and toast the courtly ideals of fine living, drinking, socializing, and versifying in the spirit of sprezzatura (a casual grace).<seg>[2]<note type="gloss"><bibl>Ann Baynes Coiro, “The Personal Rule of Poets: Cavalier Poetry and the English Revolution,” <title rend="italic">The Oxford Handbook of Literature and the English Revolution</title>, ed. Laura Lunger Knoppers (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), 206-37.</bibl> The poems by Cavendish and Philips post-date Pulter’s Poem 64, but they display similar convictions. Pulter likely owned a copy of Cavendish’s <title rend="italic">Poems, and Fancies written by the Right Honourable, the Lady Margaret Newcastle</title> (London, 1653). Philips defended the (dead) king’s reputation against the libel of Fifth Monarchist and Approver of Ministers, Vavasor Powell, in “Upon the Double Murther of K. Charles I,” which was not published until 1667, but was written in the early 1650s. See <bibl>Philips, <title rend="italic">Poems by the most deservedly Admired Mrs. Katherine Philips, the matchless Orinda</title> (London, 1667), 1-2.</bibl></note></seg> Among the Cavalier poets who produced meditative verses on retreat, loss, exile, and death, which may have influenced Pulter, was Thomas Carew. His posthumous 1640 volume, titled “Poems,” is assumed to be among Pulter’s library holdings. Pulter likely also possessed a copy of Robert Herrick’s <title rend="italic">Hesperides</title> or, <title rend="italic">The works both humane &amp; divine of Robert Herrick, Esq.</title> (1648) among whose poetic themes are the civil wars and Charles I’s stellification. “To the King,” for example, describes “my <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi> [who] shines here, / A Publike Light (in this immensive Sphere).” Herrick’s <title rend="italic">Noble Numbers: or, His Pious Pieces</title> (1647) in <title rend="italic">Hesperides</title> (1648) contains various poems hailing the king, including “Good Friday: <foreign rend="italic">Rex Tragicus</foreign>; or, Christ Going to His Crosse,” which eerily predicts Charles’s execution and prophesies his ascent: “begin, great King! Ascend Thy throne, / And thence proceed, to act Thy Passion / To such an height, to such a period rais’d, / As Hell, and Earth, and Heav’n may stand amazed.”<seg>[3]<note type="gloss"><bibl>Herrick, <title rend="italic">Hesperides</title> or, <title rend="italic">The works both humane &amp; divine of Robert Herrick, Esq.</title> (London, 1648), 278; <title rend="italic">His Noble Numbers: or, His Pious Pieces</title>, in <title rend="italic">Hesperides</title>, 74.</bibl></note></seg> Pulter’s Poem 64 will also commemorate and raise Charles to the spheres.</p>
                <p>Pulter’s pro-monarchy poems are solemn, biblical, and formal—in line with many of the elegiac works composed in response to the regicide and the release of the most popular book of the seventeenth century, <title rend="italic">Eikon Basilike</title>, a copy of which Pulter probably owned.<seg>[4]<note type="critical">Stefan Graham Christian categorizes <title rend="italic">Eikon Basilike</title> as a “possible” holding in Pulter’s library. See <bibl>Christian’s authoritative and valuable list of Pulter’s library books, certain and probable, in Christian, “The Poems of Lady Hester Pulter (1605?–1678): An Annotated Edition” (2012), 60–64. Doctoral Dissertations Available from Proquest. AAI3545910.</bibl> Pulter was introduced in London to William Dugard, the printer of <title rend="italic">Eikon Basilike</title> (<bibl>Sarah C. E. Ross and Elizabeth Scott-Baumann, eds., <title rend="italic">Women Poets of the English Civil War</title> [Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2018], 90</bibl>). Charles’s book is heavily reliant on the Psalms, as is Pulter’s poetry; in the case of Poem 64, note, for example, the indebtedness to Psalm 137.</note></seg> Purportedly in prayer, Charles I appeals in <title rend="italic">Eikon Basilike</title> to a higher form of truth and justice, and performs acts of self-examination and devotion, for which James I, John Donne, and George Herbert had supplied examples.<seg>[5]<note type="critical">Refer to the Curation entitled <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Pulter reads <title rend="italic">Eikon Basilike</title></ref> for the foldout and title page of <title rend="italic">Eikon Basilike</title>. Authored by Charles I and John Gauden, <title rend="italic">Eikon Basilike. The pourtraicture of His sacred Majestie in his solitudes and sufferings</title> was printed by William Dugard (London, 1649). Charles was indebted to Sandys’s metrical translation of the psalter, <bibl><title rend="italic">A Paraphrase Upon the Psalmes of David in A Paraphrase Upon the Divine Poems</title> (London, 1636, rev. ed. 1638, rpt. 1648)</bibl>, which was dedicated to the monarch and his spouse, and intended for singing in the Chapel Royal.</note></seg> Pulter also adopted these writers as literary models, and in Poem 64, in the role of “Time’s fair Virgin Daughter,” unsheathes not a sword but a stylus to justify the legitimacy and legacy of kingship. The poet-speaker opens by asking Job’s question to God about whether “the sword this controverse [must] decide.” In the course of the poem, she demonstrates—as in the Epistle to the Hebrews 4:12 and in a contemporary book Pulter likely owned, Robert Burton’s 1621 <title rend="italic">Anatomy of Melancholy</title>—that “It is an old saying, <hi rend="italic">A blow with a word, strikes deeper then a blow with a sword</hi>.”<seg>[6]<note type="gloss"><bibl>Robert Burton, <title rend="italic">The Anatomy of Melancholy</title> (Oxford, 1621), 1.2.4.4, p. 196.</bibl></note></seg> Poem 64 delivers a blow in verse form.</p>
                <p>“And Must the Sword” resonates with other poems in Pulter’s oeuvre, including the tearful <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="14">On the Horrid Murder of that Incomparable Prince</ref>, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="15">Let None Sigh More for Lucas or for Lisle [On the Same [2]]</ref>, which takes up the theme of Poem 14, and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="27">On the King’s Most Excellent Majesty</ref>. Pre-1649 Pulter poems that set the scene and supply interpretative frames for those on the regicide are <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="13">Upon the Imprisonment of his Sacred Majesty</ref>, written in 1647, and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="7">On those Two Unparalleled Friends, Sir George Lisle and Sir Charles Lucas</ref>, written c. 1648. These royalist poems provide her with a venue for political commentary, an uncharacteristic mode of expression for a female poet whose repertoire consists largely of personal poetry. However, she (Hester) identifies herself repeatedly in her oeuvre with and as the Noble Hadassah, a savior of her chosen nation.</p>

Neither the Geneva Bible nor the King James Bible (KJB)—which is the “Authorized Version” for readers of the time—provides the translation or paraphrase of Job 9:23 that Pulter uses for the opening line of Poem 64. And neither Stefan Christian nor Alice Eardley mentions Sandys’s <title rend="italic">A Paraphrase Upon Job</title> in their editions of Pulter’s poems (for Eardley, see <bibl><title rend="italic">Lady Hester Pulter: Poems, Emblems, and The Unfortunate Florinda</title>, ed.

                <p>Many of the themes and figures used by Sandys in his paraphrase (or what we might call an amplified edition) of Job appear in Pulter’s present poem, which reflects on providence and divine judgement. However, by virtue of rendering “And with his Sword the controverse decides” into a rhetorical question, Pulter is re-paraphrasing Sandys’s <title rend="italic">A Paraphrase Upon Job</title>. That Pulter is generally fascinated by Job is apparent as well in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="13">Upon the Imprisonment of his Sacred Majesty</ref>, in which she describes Charles: “Then let our Job-like saint rise from the ground / For piety and patience so renowned / That for the best of kings he may be crowned” (Elemental Edition, lines 13-15).</p></note></seg></rdg>

Poet Anne Bradstreet wrote about the crises of the “present troubles” in like terms, and textual evidence in Pulter’s poetry suggests she owned a copy of Bradstreet’s 1650 <title rend="italic">The Tenth Muse lately sprung up in America. Or severall poems, compiled with great variety of wit and learning, full of delight ... By a Gentlewoman in those parts</title> (London, 1650). See the Curation entitled <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Pulter Reads Bradstreet’s <title rend="italic">Tenth Muse</title></ref>. Composed in 1643, Bradstreet’s “A Dialogue between Old <hi rend="italic">England</hi> and New, concerning their present troubles. Anno 1642,” which laments the civil wars, is greatly indebted to French Huguenot poet Guillaume de Salluste Du Bartas’s “Dialogue upon the Troubles past: Betweene Heraclitus and Democritus, the weeping and the laughing Philosophers.” Pulter probably owned a copy of Du Bartas in translation—<title rend="italic">Du Bartas his Devine Weekes and Workes</title> by Josuah Sylvester (London, 1611). “A Dialogue” appears on pp. 759-63. Although she was a Puritan, Bradstreet, like her community, championed the cause of the king and decried the sufferings of the victims of war.</note></seg> eyes;</rdg>

See the Curation <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Pulter Reads Whitney’s <title rend="italic">Emblemes</title></ref>. Whitney’s very popular <title rend="italic">Choice of Emblemes</title> is a highly likely candidate for inclusion among Pulter’s library holdings. In “And Must the Sword,” Pulter’s speaker assumes the role of Truth (aligned with the “Poles of Truth”) who writes and transports the king into truth’s orbit. The poet thus “pen[s] his story” and immortalizes him, as she did in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="27">On the King’s Most Excellent Majesty</ref> (1649-1651), in which his own “valor fills with wonder future story, / Whilst virtue crowns him with immortal glory” (elemental edition, lines 3-4). To eulogize Charles I, Pulter picks up the thread (the poem’s theme or storyline), which is connected to the thread of grace or divine favor.</p>
                <p>Sandys assigns the job of settling the controversy not to the sword but to justice: “By Equitie let us our Judgements guide: / And this long controverted Cause decide” (<title rend="italic">A Paraphrase Upon Job</title>, p. 44). In and through verses that plead for justice and the righteous restoration of kingship, Pulter implies that Truth, penned by the poet and identified as the poet, will restore order, and thus reverse the confusion of tongues and the babble. The term “truth” appears twice in the poem directly, once associated with the king’s movements and then with divine truth that envelops the king’s people who live, move, and have their being in him. But it is also inferred by the reference to Time’s Daughter who uses verses to forge the identifications between truths.</p></note></seg> pen his story,</rdg>

                Dissolve[d]/involve[d] is perhaps Pulter’s most frequently used rhymed couplet.

Milton’s “On the morning of Christs Nativity.

The anaphora (“Let …. Let”) marking the last eight lines links the actions and connects the movements described in the poem. The concluding lines of Poem 64 are also reminiscent of Bradstreet’s prophetic benediction (with its anaphora) that constitutes the final speech in “A Dialogue” and envisions an elect, unified England.
