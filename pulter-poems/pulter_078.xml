          <p>Apparent errors are preserved and editorial corrections provided using SIC and CORR tags, but only where the editor conjectures that the original scribe or compositor would have recognized the instance as an error. For example, what according to modern usage is incorrect subject/verb agreement might have been deemed acceptable to a seventeenth-century scribe or compositor. All such instances are treated instead using the ORIG and REG tags. (See below.)</p>
          <p>Corrections and annotations made within the scope of the original document either by its original authors, owners, and/or transcribers are noted using ADD tags. These annotations and may be further explained within NOTE tags, as added by the editors of this digital edition, for display within the apparatus.</p>

            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

          <rdg wit="#ee">
              <note type="headnote">In this emblem, Pulter draws on two animals—the whale and the crocodile—to exemplify a common lesson: because people in a social hierarchy are interdependent, those at the top should appreciate the labors of those below. But there is nothing predictable about the vivid, or even lurid, scenarios she paints of creatures who are medicated and fed by the intestinal juices, waste products, and half-chewed food scraps of other creatures. Drawing on Jewish lore, the Bible, and natural history, the speaker first imagines Jonah’s three-day voyage into the belly of the beast as an invigorating retreat featuring a diet of fatty tissue with a side dish of “poignant sauce and unctuous caviar;” yet even the whale, whose powerful instrumentality as a host is divinely sanctioned, cannot survive without the help of a tiny fish, who benefits in turn from the whale’s leftovers. The Egyptian crocodile’s symbiotic relationship with a wren provides the second example: in sentences whose shifting pronouns make the identities of three animals dizzyingly unstable, the speaker shows that the powerful crocodile depends on a small bird’s warning that rats will crawl into its body to feast on its intestines; as a reward, the wren gets to pick half-eaten food from the beast’s teeth. The reader may remember the visceral disgust created by her examples more than Pulter’s simple if valuable moral about interdependency.</note>

In regard whereof cometh the wren, a little bird called there Trochilos, and the king of birds in Italy: and she, for her victual’s sake, hoppeth first about his mouth, falleth to pecking and picking it with her little neb or bill, and so forward to the teeth, which she cleanseth; and all to make him gape.

While this may be a scribal error, it was not corrected by the hand that is probably Pulter’s; as such, the gender confusion may enhance the general blurring of identities created by confusing pronouns designating the bird and crocodile in the next lines. Eardley alters this pronoun, as well as the next two referring to the crocodile, to “him,” which stabilizes the crocodile’s gender. A reader might just as legitimately alter the two pronouns used earlier to refer to the crocodile to create a consistently female-gendered animal.</note></seg> foe,</rdg>
