          <rdg wit="#ae">The Invocation of the Elements the <seg>Longest Night<note type="critical">Pulter includes a specific time stamp in several of her poems’ titles, such as <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="4">The Complaint of Thames, 1647</ref> and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="45">This Was Written in 1648, When I Lay in, With my Son John</ref>. In this title, Pulter is hyper-specific, noting both year and date of composition. The “longest night” refers to the winter solstice (or midwinter), always mid-December for the Earth’s Northern Hemisphere. Pulter’s specificity here urges us to think about how the poem’s title offers important framing for its content—a meditation on the relationship among darkness, despair, and death. As we’ll see, the poet pleads for death by water, air, fire, and earth as the poem progresses. But even as this time stamp consequently seems the perfect framing for such a poem, the poem’s central themes are also undermined by this title. The winter solstice is a turning point, part of a yearly cycle. The longest night immediately gives way to the gradual lengthening of daylight and nature’s spring awakening. The poem’s title, then, raises some important questions for reading: Within the poem’s prominent themes of darkness, despair, and death, do we glimpse hope? Are there any signs of light in this seemingly dark poem?</note></seg> in the Year 1655</rdg>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

              <note type="editorialnote"><p>In my editions of Pulter’s poems, I prioritize accessibility and use my annotations to prompt further exploration. To make the poems accessible to the widest possible audience, I have modernized spelling, punctuation, and capitalization according to American English standards. My editions aim to demonstrate the complexity of Pulter’s thinking, while opening space for the reader’s own analysis and interpretation. I recognize editing as a political act and aim to be as transparent as possible about how I frame Pulter’s poems for the reader. My lengthy annotations are an attempt to reveal my thought processes and make clear the ideological networks that inform my readings.</p>
                <p>As an important corollary to Pulter’s conceptual work, I also attend to the material expression of her manuscript object. Her manuscript pages reveal a glimpse of her thinking and writing processes, and I briefly note Pulter’s revisions to the poems in order to foreground her poetic craft. The manuscript features variants and revisions that invite multiple interpretations, and I encourage readers to refer to the manuscript images as they engage with Pulter’s writing. I offer some intertextual references to other early modern texts, but am most interested in drawing out how Pulter’s poems speak to each other as she reflects on clusters of ideas.</p></note>

              <note type="headnote">Inscribed beneath the title of this poem is not just a year, as in several other Pulter poems, but a precise indication of the date of composition: the winter solstice, the darkest day of any year. Pulter’s general preoccupation with astronomical observation is thus reflected here, as is her larger concern with—and, often, morbid fixation on—the darkness of the night sky and her corresponding emotional state. This night, though, the speaker invites guests to a wonderful feast: darkness seems, at first, at bay. But we soon realize that the main course she plans to serve is her own body, carved into its constitutive elements of water, air, fire and earth. Those elements are also, paradoxically, her invitees, along with her soul, whose impatience to die motivates the occasion and the poem. Like any good host, the speaker serves up pleasing dishes and chatty flattery at the same time, in a sequence of dramatic monologues implied in her instructions to “ask no more” and “say no more” formulations (echoing <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="11">Tell Me No More [On the Same]</ref> and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="13">Upon the Imprisonment of His Sacred Majesty</ref>). While initially cordial, the speaker’s table-talk at times edges toward indecorous demands to be liquified, vaporized, chilled, and consumed into the earth, increasingly signalling the urgency with which she seeks her death; her sadness at that of her “lovely children”—<hi rend="italic">seven</hi>, horribly, by this date—rationalizes her insistence on returning to her own “mother,” the Earth addressed here.</note>

          <rdg wit="#ae">
              <note type="headnote"><p>What is an elegy and how do we know when we’re reading one? The standard definition of an elegy is a lament for the dead, stemming from the Greek word <foreign rend="italic">elegos</foreign>, or “song of mourning.” Pulter’s “Invocation of the Elements” does not explicitly call attention to itself as an elegy; in fact, it reads much more like a philosophical investigation. Like many of Pulter’s poems, it grapples with a range of themes surrounding mortality: nature, cosmology, redemption, and the relationship between body and soul. The poem opens with the poet pleading for death as her soul “rowl[s]” in darkness. The poet then invokes and addresses each of the four elements in turn—water, air, fire, and earth—as she explores the different ways her body and soul could be consumed.</p>
                  <p>But by line 8, when the poet references her “sad heart,” we glimpse the grief and despair that pervade this poem. Pulter invokes the elements and pleads for death as an antidote to the overwhelming trauma of losing seven children—“seven lovely buds” that have been “drawn dry” (line 21). That trauma and Pulter’s resulting grief drive the poem, which consequently explores how grief can inform and be informed by natural philosophy (a precursor to our modern understanding of science and its various fields of inquiry). Simultaneously lamentation for the dead and philosophical investigation, this poem offers an unusual example of an early modern elegy and a particularly complex aesthetic-scientific object.</p>
                <p>In this edition of the poem, I explore several interrelated questions. First, how does Pulter both describe and perform grief throughout the poem? In other words, how does she invite the reader, through language and form, to <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> her grief over her children’s deaths? This performance of grief extends to the manuscript’s material features. The ample blank spaces between the poem’s stanzas invite us to consider what roles absence and silence can play in poetic representations of grief. Pulter’s manuscript includes more explicit elegies (<ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="10">Upon the Death of my Dear and Lovely Daughter, Jane Pulter</ref>), and other poems that function more like “Invocation of the Elements”—we might call them elegy-hybrids (see, for instance, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="7">On those Two Unparalleled Friends, Sir George Lisle and Sir Charles Lucas, Who Were Shot to Death at Colchester</ref>). How does “Invocation of the Elements”  work alongside those others and invite us to extend our understanding of what an elegy is and the kind of work it does? As Frances E. Dolan notes about Pulter’s poem on Lisle and Lucas, “this poem is an anguished lament, but about what exactly?” (see Curation, <ref type="pp-curation-ref" target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/poems/ee/on-those-two-unparalleled-friends-sir-george-lisle-and-sir-charles-lucas-who-were-shot-to-death-at-colchester/#commemorating-the-dead">Commemorating the Dead</ref>).</p>
                <p>Second, my annotations consider the poem’s intersecting “modes of knowing”—Valerie Traub’s useful phrase for the methods by which things come to be known.<seg>1<note type="gloss">Traub, “The Nature of Norms in Early Modern England: Anatomy, Cartography, <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi>,” <title rend="italic">South Central Review</title> 26:1/2 (2009): 42-81.</note></seg> In this poem, Pulter draws on many different modes of knowing that we would now separate into discrete fields, or disciplines: philosophy (“For what is death but cold and night, / Life being only heat and light?”); chemistry (“I into tears am rarified”); and physiology (“Then will my heart forget to beat / And trepidate within my breast”). The poem is also deeply informed by Pulter’s experience as a mother. How are these different modes of knowing displayed and how do they interact throughout the poem? How does this poem’s network of knowledges continue to enhance our understanding of Pulter as both poet and thinker?</p>
                  <p>The poem’s central conceit—the four elements—provides an important example of how different modes of knowing converge. The elements had philosophical, medical, and spiritual resonances in the early modern period, and we see all of these at work in Pulter’s poem. Inherited from Greek philosophy, early moderns used the four elements to explain nature and the different kinds of matter that exist in nature. Medically, the four elements were linked to the humoral theory of the body. Through the seventeenth-century, the dominant physiological theory was that the human body is made up of fluids. The essential fluids, or humors, corresponded to the four elements and to four distinct stages of life: blood (warm/moist physical qualities linked to air and infancy); yellow bile (warm/dry physical qualities linked to fire and youth); black bile (cold/dry physical qualities linked to earth and adulthood); and phlegm (cold/moist physical qualities linked to water and old age). Spiritually (or, perhaps, cosmologically), the four elements were also an important part of the microcosm-macrocosm understanding of the world—a way to explain humanity’s place in the universe. As Pulter interacts with each element in turn, where and how do we see these different modes of knowing intersect?</p></note>

The modernization illuminates several useful connotations for Pulter’s word choice: “roll” can mean revolve, proceed, wander, or be enveloped. Maintaining Pulter’s original spelling, though, reminds us of the term’s important etymological (and aural) connections to the verb “ravel,” particularly its early spellings “rauel” and “rawil.” “Ravel,” in this context, means “to entangle; to confuse, perplex; to render incoherent or muddled” (“ravel, v.1,” <title rend="italic">OED Online</title>). The feelings of confusion and incoherence evoked by this word are important for some of the later formal features I’ll track in this long poem.</note></seg>.</rdg>

The capitalization signals the importance of these entities for Pulter, and resonates with early modern understandings of the elements as particularly powerful forces. The four elements—water, air, fire, and earth—were a frequent topic of Renaissance poetry and natural philosophy. See, for instance, John Donne’s “The Dissolution,” which similarly uses the elements to reflect on loss and grief. Another useful comparison is Anne Bradstreet’s “The Four Elements.” Like Pulter, Bradstreet deals with each of the four elements in turn, but imagines the elements competing with each other to determine which is most important to human life. At the time Pulter was writing, the four elements were a familiar part of philosophical and scientific debates about the existence and creation of matter, central to the period’s renewed interest in atomism, for example.</p><p>The term “elements” might also be defined more simply as “the constituent parts of a whole.” This definition is particularly useful in thinking about the structure of Pulter’s poem—four stanzas (four “elements”) that each constitute one part of an aesthetic whole. In early modern religious contexts, “elements” could also refer to the “bread and wine used in the Sacrament of the Eucharist” (“element, n.,” <title rend="italic">OED Online</title>), which directly relates to the poem’s central conceit: death as the “last, best feast” (line 5).</p></note></seg> implore.</rdg>

The poet then invites each of the four elements to be a “guest” at the feast (line 6) and she describes the different ways her body could be consumed by each element.</note></seg>.</rdg>

          <rdg wit="#ae" rend="left-gutter-1">First, <seg>that which circles my sad heart<note type="critical">Pulter refers here to a common theory espoused in both medical and theological texts of the period: the <foreign rend="italic">pericardium</foreign>—the membrane enclosing the heart—was understood to be a thin sac of water. In Thomas Gibson’s <title rend="italic">The Anatomy of Humane Bodies Epitomized</title>, a lengthy compendium of anatomical knowledge published in several editions throughout the late-seventeenth and early-eighteenth centuries, Gibson helps his reader understand the fluid inside the pericardium by citing John 19.34: “This is that liquor that is supposed to have flown from the side of our Saviour when the soldier pierced it with a spear, for saith the Text (John 19.34.) <hi rend="italic">There came forth blood and water</hi>” (<bibl>London, 1682, Text Creation Partnership digital edition, <title rend="italic">Early English Books Online</title>, p. 233</bibl>). In Lewis Bayly’s <title rend="italic">The Practice of Piety</title>, a hugely popular devotional manual (over 70 editions published by 1821), Bayly references the same story about “blood and water” flowing from Christ’s pierced side, and includes an explanatory marginal note that strikes a distinctly anatomical tone: “There is about man’s heart a skin called <hi rend="italic">Pericardium</hi> containing water which cools and moistens the heart, lest it should be scorched with continual motion. This skin once pierced, man cannot live” (London, 1695, Text Creation Partnership digital edition, <title rend="italic">Early English Books Online</title>, p. 459).</note></seg>.</rdg>

          <rdg wit="#ae" rend="left-gutter-1">To tears I’ll quickly <seg>rarefy<note type="critical">In early modern connotations, “rarefy” most frequently meant “to make thin” or “to make less dense in texture” (“rarefy, v.,” <title rend="italic">OED Online</title>). Pulter draws on that meaning here as she contemplates how her body might be transformed into tears—the transformation of a solid into a liquid. Pulter explores similar kinds of material transformations in other poems, such as <ref  type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="16">The Revolution</ref>, where she considers how her “tears” might “rarefy / to air” (lines 28-29).</note></seg></rdg>

          <rdg wit="#ae" rend="left-gutter-1">Number them <seg>not. Count<note type="critical">The poem’s first of many medial caesuras—a break or pause in the metrical line that splits the line into two equal parts (in this case, four syllables on either side). Given Pulter’s striking, repeated use of the medial caesura in this stanza (lines 11, 15, 17, 18, 22, and 23), we might consider how her use of this formal feature compares to her contemporary poets. John Donne often uses medial caesuras in his devotional poems: “Thou hast made me, and shall thy work decay? / Repair me now, for now mine end doth haste” (“Thou hast made me,” lines 1-2). Mary Sidney, Countess of Pembroke offers another useful comparison because her psalm translations were such an important model for early modern poets like Pulter writing at the intersection of devotion and politics. In a psalm about God’s omniscience, Pembroke uses medial caesura to emphasize God’s knowledge of the poet’s movements: “if forth I march, thou goest before; / if back I turn, thou com’st behind” (Psalm 139, lines 15-16).</note></seg> sand or <seg>star—<note type="critical">Pulter revised this line in the manuscript. The original line reads: “Number them not, but count each sand or star.” The revised line emphasizes the medial caesura, adding to the midline stops and starts throughout this stanza (see my note on “not. Count”). And the edit from “each sand” to “sand” is crucial for the questions about quantification Pulter raises in these lines. “Each sand” opens the possibility for counting (a collection of grains of sand that can “each” be counted), but “sand” (like “star”) seems an abstraction, a move away from the thing as countable material and a move toward the thing as uncountable idea.</note></seg></rdg>

In this poem, weeping is not confined, as we might expect, to the “Water” stanza.

Even though she is directly addressing each of the elements, she uses “oh” as an exclamation rather than direct address (or apostrophe), often during moments when she seems overwhelmed by grief. Given the term’s frequent use in apostrophe, though, we might wonder: is this word doing double work throughout the poem?</note></seg> <seg>that they had been shed for sin<note type="critical">With this conditional construction, Pulter draws on a commonplace connection between grief and repentance (she’ll do this again later when she pairs “sin and sorrow” in line 77). If I were weeping in repentance for my sins, the poet reflects, then my tears would be valuable (“in heaven … bottled” [line 14]). Instead, the poet’s tears are shed in grief over the loss of her seven children, first referenced in line 21. This brief nod to repentance, though, raises a useful question about how Pulter links her status as mother to her devotional explorations throughout the manuscript: what kind of relationship does Pulter construct here between the possibility of spiritual redemption and the experience of maternal grief? For more on the connection between grief and repentance, particularly in women’s writing, see Elizabeth Hodgson’s <title rend="italic">Grief and Women Writers in the English Renaissance</title> (2015), especially pages 8-9.</note></seg>,</rdg>

The poet imagines Water asking about the reason for her grief (“why were they [her tears] shed?”). In response, the poet resists repeating the traumatic experiences of her children’s deaths (“If I repeat my woes, I die / a double death” [16-17]). The poet’s responses to Water recall one of Pulter’s poems on her daughter Jane’s death, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="11">Tell Me No More</ref>. In both poems Pulter contemplates poetry’s role in articulating grief. Rather than give her reader the details of her children’s deaths, how can she use poetry to mark their absence and her grief? The repetition of “tell me no more” in the poem on Jane’s death is here reprised in the repetition of the exclamatory “Oh”; the echoed phrasing “Oh ask not why” (line 15), “Oh ask no more” (line 17), and “O say no more” (line 42); and the pattern “I die / a <hi rend="italic">n</hi> death” (lines 16-17; 22-23).</note></seg>.</rdg>

Grammatically, the sentence is complete, but Pulter adds the extra weight of “double death” in the next line. How does the formal feature of enjambment contribute to Pulter’s poetic representation of grief throughout the rest of the poem? What effect does it have on the reader, particularly if the poem is read aloud?</note></seg></rdg>

For more on this term in Pulter’s poetry, see <bibl>Liza Blake, “Hester Pulter’s Particle Physics and the Poetics of Involution,” <title rend="italic">Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies</title> 20.2 (2020): 71-98</bibl>.</note></seg>.</rdg>

In John Swan’s <title rend="italic">Speculum Mundi</title>, a popular seventeenth-century encyclopedia, he links “vapors” to “clouds”: an “exhalation cold and moist, drawn from the earth out of wet or watery places” (<bibl>Cambridge, 1635, Text Creation Partnership digital edition, <title rend="italic">Early English Books Online</title>, p. 143</bibl>). When Pulter was writing, “vapor” was also a word used in relation to scent. Fragrances were still understood to be emitted as smoke or vapor, which connects to Pulter’s description of the garden in this stanza and her reference to odor as “sweet breath” (lines 36-41).</note></seg>,</rdg>

The poet goes on to describe briefly the “sweet breath” of her garden’s “blossoms” (lines 38-41), but then cuts herself off, overwhelmed again by grief. Pulter uses garden references and metaphors to do interesting work throughout the manuscript. See, for instance, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="2">Invitation to the Country</ref>, which, as Liza Blake shows us in her Amplified Edition, construes the garden as both an instrument of political agency and a space of political retreat. Or we could look at <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="118">The Snail, The Tulip, and The Bee</ref>, which imagines the garden as a female separatist community.

The “if” is significant, an exploratory tool that introduces the rhetoric of scientific inquiry into Pulter’s poem. Fire’s status as an element was increasingly contested in seventeenth-century natural philosophy. John Donne succinctly cites the debate in his “Anatomy of the World”: “and new philosophy calls all in doubt; / the element of fire is quite put out” (lines 205-206).

          <rdg wit="#ae" rend="left-gutter-1">Then will <seg>my heart forget to beat<note type="critical">Pulter’s emphasis on the heart as the body’s life-giving center recalls her lines in the “Water” stanza about the pericardium (see my note at line 8). These lines can seem a bit opaque: how will fire “hold[ing] its heat” result in the poet’s heart stopping? In William Harvey’s foundational work on the circulatory system (1628)—the first detailed account of how blood circulates through the body—Harvey associated heat with the motion of blood: “the blood, therefore, required to have motion, and indeed such a motion that it should return again to the heart … for we see motion generating and keeping up heat and spirits under all circumstances.” Harvey’s explanation helps us understand Pulter’s line: by holding its heat and, thereby, denying heat to the poet’s body, fire would cause the poet’s blood to stop circulating.

The Fire stanza, more than any of the others, seems truly an exploration, first marked by the conditional “if,” then by Pulter’s reflection on the relationship between blood and heat, and finally here by the interrogative mode at the stanza’s end.</note></seg>,</rdg>

          <rdg wit="#ae" rend="left-gutter-1">Then come, and ‘tis but <seg>Earth to Earth<note type="critical"><p>This stanza’s opening lines introduce the concept of life as a circle, succinctly captured by the phrase “Earth to Earth.” The life/death cycle provides important framing for the stanza’s maternal themes. Even though Pulter draws on her status as mother throughout the rest of the poem, in this stanza she explicitly identifies herself as “mother” (line 72) for the first time and uses that identification as leverage to petition Mother Earth.</p><p>An important context underlying Pulter’s themes in this stanza is the very real fear of death that accompanied childbirth in early modern England. Giving birth was a dangerous process and maternal and infant mortality rates were high. How does the connection between death and motherhood function in this stanza compared to, for instance, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="45">This Was Written in 1648, When I Lay in, With my Son John</ref>?

The echoes between this poem and Pulter’s more traditional elegies bring us back to my question in the poem’s “Headnote”: what is an elegy and how do we know when we’re reading one?</note></seg>,</rdg>

          <rdg wit="#ae" rend="left-gutter-1">Do but involve me in <seg>thy spacious womb<note type="critical"><p>Pulter joins many of her contemporary poets in representing Earth as a fertile mother who both gives and takes life. In John Milton’s <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title>, Hell’s demons “rifle[ ] the bowels of their mother Earth” (1.687) and, when Adam bites the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge, Milton describes the Earth “trembl[ing] from her entrails, as again / in pangs” (9.1000). Mary Sidney, Countess of Pembroke, also consistently draws on this metaphor in her psalm translations: “All things in brief, that life in life maintain, / From earth’s old bowels fresh and youngly grows” (Psalm 104, lines 47-48). Both Milton and Pembroke’s uses of this metaphor remind us that this is a common biblical trope, one with which Pulter would have been very familiar. In Pulter’s representation, Earth’s womb is central to the life/death cycle and the Earth’s “bowels” ultimately become the poet’s final desired resting place.</p><p>When I read this final stanza, I think about Pulter’s representation of Earth as a living, maternal organism in contrast to increasingly mechanistic representations of nature in seventeenth-century England. Within several decades of Pulter’s writing, changing attitudes toward science and the study of nature would result in widespread attempts to control, contain, and dominate the natural world. English poet Anna Laetitia Barbauld (1743-1825) confronts this shift in her 1773 poem <ref target="//romantic-circles.org/editions/contemps/barbauld/poems1773/invitation.html#p22" type="new-window-url">“The Invitation,”</ref> where she describes scientists that “pensive creep” and “hunt” nature “to her elemental forms.” For foundational ecofeminist work to read alongside Pulter’s representation, see <bibl>Carolyn Merchant, <title rend="italic">The Death of Nature: Women, Ecology and the Scientific Revolution</title> (Harper &amp; Row, 1980)</bibl>.</p></note></seg>.</rdg>

          <rdg wit="#ae" rend="left-gutter-1">O let thy bowels <seg>yearn<note type="critical">The poem ends with the poet voicing her desire to be incorporated back into the earth. The Earth’s “yearn[ing]” here bookends the poet’s yearning in the poem’s opening stanza (how she “implore[s]” the Elements to attend her “last, best feast”). In early modern connotations, “yearn” could mean both “to have a strong desire or longing for” and “to be deeply moved; to feel something (as compassion, sympathy, etc.) intensely” (“yearn, v.1,” <title rend="italic">OED Online</title>). The second connotation usefully extends the elegiac work of the poem we’ve traced thus far. How does this poem function not only as elegy, but specifically as a call for collective mourning? An invitation for the poem’s readers to mourn and “yearn” alongside the poet? To continue exploring these questions, we might now turn to one of Pulter’s elegies on her daughter’s death, where the poet asks “all…parents” to “lend one tear” to contribute to her lament (<ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="10">Upon the Death of my Dear and Lovely Daughter, Jane Pulter</ref>).</note></seg> and me receive.</rdg>
