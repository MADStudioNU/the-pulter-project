                        as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation,
                        capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines,
                        and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and
                        superscript and subscript representations are retained.

                    <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>
                    <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="editorialnote">This is a semi-diplomatic transcription in which original spelling and punctuation are retained, abbreviations are expanded with added letters in italics (with the exception of “ye” which is rendered as “the”), superscriptions are lowered, colons indicating abbreviations are removed, “ff” is modernized to “F,” and major alterations to the text are noted in the footnotes. The retention of original spelling and punctuation has the potential to get us closer to the choices made by the poet and scribe, but some scribal details (such as abbreviations) do not seem substantive or meaning-bearing and run the risk of alienating a modern reader.</note></rdg>

This emblem raises this quandary by telling a fable in which a Russian peasant, climbing a tree, becomes stuck inside the honey within a beehive, with no hope of escape. A bear, who ordinarily would be a threat to the man, becomes his unlikely means of salvation. Framing the story as an encouragement about not losing hope when in distress, Pulter offers a poem about the mysterious means by which God might offer redemption: a seeming enemy (here notably a fierce female) may turn out to be a miraculous source of liberation.</note></rdg>
                    <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">This emblem tells the story of a Russian peasant who gets stuck in a hollow tree full of honey. When a bear climbs into the tree she becomes his unwitting saviour, enabling him to break free when he grabs hold of her hind legs. The emblem becomes a meditation on the possibility of finding freedom and redemption when one least expects it.</note></rdg>

The ladies see through their disguises and mock them. As H.R. Woudhuysen in his 1998 Arden edition of the play explains, “Shakespeare may anticipate or echo the ambassador ‘from the mighty Emperor of <hi rend="italic">Russia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Moscovy</hi>’ who appeared in the Gray’s Inn revels celebrating Twelfth Night in 1595” (p. 243). Woudhuysen also notes that Philip Sidney uses the image of a “slave-borne <hi rend="italic">Muscovite</hi>” in <title rend="italic">Astrophil and Stella</title>, sonnet 2, line 10 (p. 243). In her edition of Sidney, Katherine Duncan-Jones notes of this line: “The Russians—Slavs—were believed by the Elizabethans to enjoy the oppressive rule of their tsar, at this time Ivan the Terrible. They were also thought comically clumsy and barbaric, as in the Muscovite disguise of the four lovers in <title rend="italic">Love’s Labour’s Lost</title>, V.ii, which probably alludes to this sonnet” (<title rend="italic">Sir Philip Sidney</title>, The Oxford Authors, Oxford University Press, [1989], p. 358). The Russian in Pulter’s poem is a country bumpkin.

H2v. It appeared in many other sources as well, probably beginning in English with Richard Eden’s translation of <title rend="italic">The decades of the newe worlde or west India</title> (1555), in an anecdote he attributes to a Russian ambassador to Rome named Demetrius, as told by Sebastian Münster and Jacobus Bastaldus. For this and a selection of later versions, see <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">The Russian Rustic and the Hollow Tree</ref> in Curations for this poem. Pulter’s syntax is a little confusing, but the other versions make it clear that the man is submerged in honey within the hollow trunk of a tree.</note></seg></rdg>

With the references to saints (in lines 3 and 7), a priest, and the patriarch (who might parallel the Pope), Pulter may be drawing a comparison between this rustic’s religion and her culture’s view of Roman Catholicism’s misguided practices.</note></seg> was nigh</rdg>
