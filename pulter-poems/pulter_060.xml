          <rdg wit="#ee"><seg>To Sir William Davenant: Upon the Unspeakable Loss of the Most Conspicuous and Chief Ornament of His Frontispiece<note type="gloss">William Davenant (1606–1668) was a famous English playwright who served as poet laureate and was knighted by Charles I. In 1630, he contracted syphilis and took mercury as a cure, which disfigured his nose. An “ornament” is an accessory; a “frontispiece” is a face but also the front of a building, the engraved panel over an entrance, or the first page or title page of a book.</note></seg>

Despite Pulter’s use of initials, there would have been little ambiguity around the identity of this knight. Davenant had contracted the pox in the late 1620s or early 1630s (in 1633 he refers to himself as a ‘long-sick Poet’). The Queen’s physician, Thomas Cademan, treated Davenant with a customary mercury salivation, in which mercury was rubbed, inhaled or ingested into the body to prompt saliva and sweating and ‘flush out’ the disease. Davenant addressed public poems of thanks that conceded his receipt of ‘Devill <hi rend="italic">Mercurie</hi>’, thus acknowledging the venereal nature of his distemper <bibl>(Mary Edmond, <title rend="italic">Rare Sir William Davenant</title> [Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1987], pp. 45–46)</bibl>. After the bridge of his nose collapsed and flattened, this became a common point of ribaldry among political and poetic rivals, whose poems are discussed in detail by Marcus Nevitt <bibl>(‘The Insults of Defeat: Royalist Responses to Sir William Davenant’s <title rend="italic">Gondibert</title> [1651]’ <title rend="italic">The Seventeenth Century</title> 24.2 [2009]: pp 287–304)</bibl>.</note></seg> Upon the unspeakable Loss of the <seg>most conspicuous and chief Ornament<note type="critical">While Pulter’s tone is mildly hyperbolic, surgeons who wrote on injuries and disfigurements to the nose often remarked on its centrality and importance for the face’s beauty, and thus the need to take particular care to reduce scarring and misshaping. Pulter refers to the importance of shape in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="11">Tell Me No More [On the Same]</ref> when she praises her daughter’s “white even nose”.</note></seg> of his Frontispiece</rdg>

            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

              <note type="editorialnote"><p>I have opted to complement the modernised Elemental Edition with a semi-diplomatic transcription in order to give readers a sense of the gains and losses in each style. I have retained original spelling and punctuation, but amended uses of u/v/w, i/j, and ff/F. Where a colon and superscription indicating abbreviation is incidental rather than substantive this has been expanded with italics; so too for the single use of a thorn for ‘the’.</p>
              <p>The poem does not have as many classical references as some of Pulter’s other work, but instead builds from a central trope drawn from contemporary medicine and science, which I have explained for the general reader. The annotations are therefore less explanatory than interpretive, based on my reading of the poem in the context of British responses to the nose and especially nose reconstruction and transplantation (see <bibl>Cock, <title rend="italic">Rhinoplasty and the nose in early modern British medicine and culture</title> [Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2019]</bibl>). As I attempt to show, there is more to this poem than a funny joke about legs and noses.</p></note>

            <note type="headnote">Sir William Davenant, who was about Pulter’s age, famously suffered from a sexually-transmitted disease as well as its cure: the medicinal application of mercury, which we now know to be terribly poisonous. The consequent disfigurement of his nose is the somewhat unusual (for Pulter) subject matter of this poem, which is equally unusual in its direct address of Davenant. While overtly sympathizing with his loss, the speaker’s imagery and imagination ranges boldly from the witty to the caustic and grotesque.</note>
          </rdg>
          <rdg wit="#ae">
              <note type="headnote"><p>In this humorous and rather uncharacteristic poem, Pulter uses contemporary understanding of nose reconstruction and transplantation to engage with Interregnum politics by imaginatively offering the playwright and poet Sir William Davenant a piece of her own body for the reconstruction of his nose. Davenant’s nasal bridge was famously sunken through the effects of the pox (syphilis) and its customary treatment with mercury. This association with venereal disease, and wider uses of nose cutting as a stigmatising punishment, meant that nasal disfigurements were considered highly dishonourable in early modern Europe.</p>
                <p>While it had its roots in real surgical procedures to rebuild a nose, lip, or ear from a flap of the patient’s own skin, the full transplantation of a skin graft between individuals was largely a fantasy, which was used by British authors to a range of discursive ends. The graft employed to reconstruct the nose was understood to remain absolutely part of the original person, and it was thought to die when the original person did due to a medical phenomenon known as ‘sympathy’. Thus, through the logic of the transplant, part of Pulter’s private body is imaginatively attached to Davenant and brought into public politics. Within the poem, the success and longevity of Davenant’s new nose—and the Royalist project and authority it represents—become contingent upon Pulter. If he fails to offer sufficient loyal service, prayers for Pulter, and care for the nose in recompense, he will be truly worth the dishonour of noselessness.</p></note>

            <rdg wit="#ae">To <seg>cut you out another Nose<note type="critical">Pulter refers to belief that a new nose could be constructed from skin or flesh taken from another person. The origins for this belief lie in Bolognese surgeon Gaspare Tagliacozzi’s (1545–1599) techniques for reconstructing a nose, lip or ear using skin flaps taken from the patient’s own arm, which he detailed in a lavishly illustrated Latin folio, <bibl><title rend="italic">De curtorum chirurgia per insitionem</title> (Venice: 1597)</bibl> (for Tagliacozzi’s operation and career in the context of Italian surgery see <bibl>Valeria Finucci, <title rend="italic">The Prince’s Body: Vincenzo Gonzaga and Renaissance Medicine</title> [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2015)</bibl>; <bibl>Paolo Savoia, <title rend="italic">Gaspare Tagliacozzi and Early Modern Surgery: Faces, Men, and Pain</title> [London: Routledge, 2019]</bibl>). The use of skin flaps in this way has ancient origins, but in early modern Europe Tagliacozzi enjoyed a monopolist (but controversial) reputation after publication. Professional misunderstandings and popular rumours led to widespread belief that the new nose could also be built using a graft from someone else, though Tagliacozzi had rejected the feasibility of this operation.</note></seg></rdg>

It also means that Pulter is unlikely to have known other members of the Royalist ‘Cavendish Circle’ in Paris who promoted sympathetic medicine, such as Walter Charleton and Sir Kenelm Digby, thus further restricting her sources for this knowledge (on these men and sympathy see <bibl>Seth Lobis, <title rend="italic">The Virtue of Sympathy: Magic, Philosophy, and Literature in Seventeenth-Century England</title> [New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2015]</bibl>; <bibl>Elizabeth Hedrick, “Romancing the Salve: Sir Kenelm Digby and the Powder of Sympathy”, <title rend="italic">The British Journal for the History of Science</title> 41.2 (2008): 161–85</bibl>; <bibl>Emily Booth, <title rend="italic">A Subtle and Mysterious Machine: The Medical World of Walter Charleton (1619–1707)</title> [Dordrecht: Springer, 2006]</bibl>).</note></seg> would <seg>sleight the pain<note type="critical">Pulter’s iteration that she would slight (brush off, disregard) the pain of the operation undercuts the modesty of her surrounding protestations that <hi rend="italic">anyone</hi>, male or female, would be willing to give up their flesh to help restore Davenant’s nose and honour, thus increasing the value of her offer.</note></seg></rdg>

            <rdg wit="#ae">Your Nose noe doubt will <seg>Sympathize<note type="critical">‘Sympathy’ was a system of influence between matter that was at a physical distance (see Lobis; <bibl>Evelyn L. Forget, ‘Evocations of Sympathy: Sympathetic Imagery in Eighteenth-Century Social Theory and Physiology’, <title rend="italic">History of Political Economy</title> 35 (2005): 282–308</bibl>). Medically it could be used to treat a patient elsewhere, such as healing a wound by applying a ‘weapon salve’ to the weapon that had made it. When applied to allograft rhinoplasty, the doctrine of sympathy dictated that when the person from whom the skin graft was taken died, the new nose would ‘die’ with them. Sympathy was contentious, and increasingly elaborate stories of nose transplants would later be used to satirise believers (<bibl>Alanna Skuse, ‘“Keep your face out of my way or I’ll bite off your nose”: Homoplastics, Sympathy, and the Noble Body in <title rend="italic">The Tatler</title>, 1710’, <title rend="italic">Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies</title> 17.4 (2017): 113–132</bibl>). Samuel Butler included a joke about a reconstructed nose in the first part of his wildly successful mock-epic poem, <title rend="italic">Hudibras</title> (1662), which cemented the mythology of the sympathetic nose as being sourced from a lower-class man’s buttocks (in <bibl>Butler, ‘The brawny part of Porter’s Bum’</bibl>) to restore the nose of a higher-status man. Thus Pulter warns Davenant that he should pray for the preservation of her own life as much as his, since if she dies (visits the ‘sad shades below’) so too will his new nose. Pulter’s reiteration that Davenant’s new nose will in fact be <hi rend="italic">her</hi> skin offers an imaginative means by which a piece of her body will be present at the centre of Royalist politics, while the rest of her is politely ensconced in her country estate.</note></seg></rdg>

The virtuous Orlando is jilted by his beloved, Angelica, in favour of an African soldier, Medore, and loses his wits. Pulter suggests that Davenant’s noselessness might lead to similar rejections if it cannot balance out his good qualities of nobility and intelligence, leading him to be rejected by a Lass whom Cupid (the “blind Boy”) leads him to adore. Nevitt highlights that Orlando’s fault “is as much a renunciation of religious and political allegiance as it is a capitulation to bestial instinct”, thus rendering Pulter’s integration of the poem further commentary on Davenant’s possible exacerbation of sexual with <hi rend="italic">political</hi> weakness (<bibl>‘Insults’, 289</bibl>).</note></seg></rdg>

This adds further weight to my belief that she was unfamiliar with Tagliacozzi’s original <title rend="italic">De curtorum chirurgia per insitionem</title>, and instead accessed understanding of the nose reconstructions from sympathy books like Walter Charlton’s translation of <bibl>Johannes Baptista van Helmont’s <title rend="italic">A Ternary of Paradoxes</title> (London: 1649)</bibl>.</note></seg> sit and at us Scofe</rdg>
