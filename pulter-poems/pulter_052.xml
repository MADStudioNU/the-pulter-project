                        The aim of the elemental edition to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers,
                        which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and
                        punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might
                        otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not
                        modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote
                        aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by
                        Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to
                        allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various
                        possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure
                        material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford
                        Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s
                        edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The
                        result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.

                    <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">This poem combines devotional verse with an interest in physics and astronomy. The image of Pulter as a tired pilgrim crawling toward God contrasts strikingly, in terms of scale, with the rotation of the sun and vastness of the heavens. The speaker’s desire to mutate into a sun is echoed in other poems in which she imagines space travel, the motions of planets, and the freedom of not being bound by human form. In this poem, however, her desire for transformation is linked to a commitment to help those who are vulnerable (children and the poor) and beloved (her friends). The majority of the poem is concerned with how she would return heat and light, as praise, to God, who was the source of all creation.</note></rdg>
                    <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">“The Wish” is a philosophical thought experiment. While its central conceit—the speaker’s professed desire to have the power of the sun—suggests a paradox or impossibility, the poem uses it to explore the metaphorical possibilities of new philosophical developments. What difference does it make if the stars are suns (and the sun is a star)? “The Wish” offers one possible answer to that question.</note></rdg>

                      <p>A parenthetical interjection (common in Pulter’s poetry) redefines “stars” as “suns,” which draws upon astronomical speculation about the plurality of worlds by suggesting that each of the stars may be a sun with its own Earth-like planets. This debate appears frequently in seventeenth-century poetry, often in lines that interrogate the metaphorical and philosophical consequences of cosmic pluralism. <bibl><author>John Donne’s</author> lament in the <title rend="italic">First Anniversary</title> (1611)</bibl> that “the new philosophy calls all in doubt” is a touchstone. Donne suggests that astronomical discovery threatens previous models of social stability:</p>

                      <p>Other poets, however, explored the creative possibilities of cosmic pluralism, notably <bibl><author>Margaret Cavendish</author>, who in <title rend="italic">Poems and Fancies</title> (1653)</bibl> published several poems, including “A World in an Eare-ringe,” “If Infinite Worlds There Must be Infinite Centers,” and “A World Made by Atoms.” Cavendish’s “Of Stars” explicitly questions whether stars are suns: “But who knows, but those stars we see by night / Are suns which to some other worlds give light?” (see <bibl><title rend="italic">Poems and Fancies</title> pp. 35-36</bibl>). These debates also make up the subject of Adam’s conversation with Raphael in book 8 of <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title>:</p>
