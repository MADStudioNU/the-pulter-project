          <p>Apparent errors are preserved and editorial corrections provided using SIC and CORR tags, but only where the editor conjectures that the original scribe or compositor would have recognized the instance as an error. For example, what according to modern usage is incorrect subject/verb agreement might have been deemed acceptable to a seventeenth-century scribe or compositor. All such instances are treated instead using the ORIG and REG tags. (See below.)</p>
          <p>Corrections and annotations made within the scope of the original document either by its original authors, owners, and/or transcribers are noted using ADD tags. These annotations and may be futher explained within NOTE tags, as added by the editors of this digital edition, for display within the apparatus.</p>

          <p>Original spellings, abbreviations, and orthography are preserved.

            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

          <rdg wit="#ee">
            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

              <note type="headnote">Pigs, boars, and hogs do not fare well in Pulter’s moral zoo. As in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="99">Mark But Those Hogs (Emblem 34)</ref> where grunting, earth-bound pigs are unfavorably compared to heavenly turtledoves, Pulter here contrasts the filth of pigs to the purity of ermines. Citing proverbial, biblical, and mythological sources, Pulter explores the pig’s refusal to remain pure even when cleansed: like the dog who slurps up his own vomit, the pig almost cannot resist falling back into muddy cycles of immorality. Pulter interprets the ermine’s legendary willingness to sacrifice herself rather than have her fur tainted in Christian terms: her whiteness is precious because washed by Christ’s blood. The poem is formally innovative in dividing into two sections, each composed of two stanzas of triplets followed by a 6-line stanza of couplets. While the narrator seems to be guiding readers from a position of moral confidence, the ending couplet transforms into a plea that makes her complicit in the struggle to avoid being swine-like in the mire of life.</note>
