            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note>

                <p>As an important corollary to Pulter’s conceptual work, I also attend to the material expression of her manuscript object. Her manuscript pages reveal a glimpse of her thinking and writing processes, and I briefly note Pulter’s revisions to the poems in order to foreground her poetic craft. The manuscript features variants and revisions that invite multiple interpretations, and I encourage readers to refer to the manuscript images as they engage with Pulter’s writing. I offer some intertextual references to other early modern texts, but am most interested in drawing out how Pulter’s poems speak to each other as she reflects on clusters of ideas.</p></note>

            <note type="headnote">We all know the cliché of the busy bee, but Pulter found in the bee an emblem not of virtuous industry but instead of overzealous curiosity, greed, and poor judgment. After praising “the active Amazonian maid” for her industriousness and herbalist know-how, this emblem tells of how the bee—having collected her fill of nectar, but unable to leave well enough alone—becomes trapped in a tulip when, at day’s end, its petals close around her. The bee works furiously to escape; a snail, similarly caught, falls asleep without a struggle. In the morning, when the petals reopen, the snail simply leaves, while the bee dies of exhaustion. Pulter sees in her garden an all-female community of vegetable, animal, and celestial beings demonstrating the moral which the poem then shows men to have enacted historically, in a sequence of exemplars warning against impatience and fighting fate. While that may be the overall moral, the poem also touches on the tension between confinement and freedom which so often preoccupies Pulter. The framing phrase for the emblem’s moral—“if no hope of liberty you see”—closely tracks the concluding declaration in “Why Must I Thus Forever Be Confined” (Poem 57): “I no liberty expect to see …” Did Pulter identify with the snail or the bee?</note>

              <note type="headnote"><p>Emblem 53 offers a complex political allegory masquerading as a fable about a “covetous” honey bee, a patient snail, and a “painted” tulip. Alongside the poem’s political themes, Pulter raises questions about gender, science, and nature that echo her interest in these topics throughout the manuscript. Most significantly, there are glimpses in this poem of Pulter’s clever theorization of poetry itself—her ongoing exploration of how poetry makes meaning.</p><p>Three distinct, but related, mottoes drive this emblem. The first motto—”then let impatient spirits here but see / what ’tis to struggle with their destiny” (lines 37–8)—concludes the story Pulter tells of a honey bee, enticed by the poet’s sumptuous garden, who tries to gather more “nectar” than she can carry. Straying from the hive for far too long, the bee lands in a tulip alongside a snail just as the sun goes down and the tulip closes its petals. The second and third motto come in sequence at the poem’s end: “’tis valianter by far to live than die” (line 50) and “then if no hope of liberty you see, / think on the snail, the tulip, and the bee” (lines 51–52). These mottoes follow a catalogue of examples from classical history, mostly warnings about excessive pride and arrogance. Three mottoes is a lot for one emblem, which raises interesting questions as we read this poem. How do the three mottoes work together? Do the stories seem to unfold logically into their concluding mottoes or do the mottoes seem incongruous? How does Pulter use these multiple mottoes to invite us to consider the function of the motto as a feature of emblems?</p><p>Pulter’s emblem poems are “naked emblems,” as Millie Godfrey and Sarah C. E. Ross explain in their introduction to <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="67">Mighty Nimrod (Emblem 1)</ref>. Revising the traditional tripartite structure of the emblem (motto, visual image, and short epigrammatic verse), Pulter omits the visual image (<foreign rend="italic">pictura</foreign>) element such that the reader must glean meaning solely from words. But Pulter’s language in this and many of her emblems is meant to help the reader paint their own picture. Here, for instance, Pulter references specific flowers, tracks the bee’s movements as it flits around the poet’s garden, and fills her lines with evocative descriptions (the morning sun is “lapped in a robe of silver mixed with gray” [line 5]). The emblem’s central characters—the snail, the tulip, and the bee—would also have been easy visual reference points for Pulter’s readers. All three figures were frequently portrayed in early modern emblem books, textual illustrations, and artwork.</p><p>All three figures are also at the center of early modern debates surrounding gender and sexuality. Even though none of the poem’s mottoes directly concern these topics, this emblem has much to teach us about Pulter’s interest and intervention in these debates. I track this theme throughout my annotations on the poem, noting, for instance, that Pulter’s description of the bee as “the active Amazonian maid” (7) refers to a community of warrior women in Greek mythology (the Amazons), who were notoriously complicated gendered figures in early modern culture. “Demonstrating that women and men might be performatively interchangeable,” Kathryn Schwarz explains, “Amazons at once substantiate the signifiers of masculinity and threaten to replace the bodies to which they are attached.”<seg>1<note type="gloss">Source: <bibl>Schwarz, <title rend="italic">Tough Love: Amazon Encounters in the English Renaissance</title> (Duke University Press, 2000): 38</bibl>.</note></seg> Amazons were often at the center of crossdressing plots (Philip Sidney’s <title rend="italic">The Countess of Pembroke’s Arcadia</title>), tales of women’s military leadership (Margaret Cavendish’s Bell in <title rend="italic">Campo</title>), and stories about the relationship between desire and power (William Shakespeare’s <title rend="italic">A Midsummer Night’s Dream</title>).</p><p>Pulter’s comparison of the bee to an “Amazonian maid” draws on this popular trope, but we might also read the comparison as an opening nod to the poem’s formal structure. The poem’s first half outlines a distinctly female garden community, populated by “fair Aurora” (1), the “Amazonian” bee” (7), the poet herself (17), and even the snail that slides about “upon her unctuous breast” (29). When the bee’s plot ends at line 37, though, the poem shifts to solely male reference points. Pulter mentions Biron (39), Belisarius (41), Bajazeth (43), and Callisthenes (47) as she guides the reader toward the poem’s concluding motto. But, shifting once more in the final couplet, Pulter ends by reminding us to “think on the snail, the tulip, and the bee” (52), a return to the female cast of the poem’s first half. In the formal structure of her poem—the gender-bending shifts in metaphors—Pulter brings to mind the threat posed by the figure of the Amazon: the possibility “that women and men might be performatively interchangeable.” In both the content and form of this poem, Pulter raises questions about how gender signifies, and particularly how emblematic, gender-specific metaphors signify.</p></note>

                <note type="headnote"><p>To most seventeenth-century readers, Hester Pulter’s bee in Emblem 53 must have seemed unusual indeed. While the vast majority of her contemporaries praised bees for “their labour and order at home and abroad,” which made them “so admirable, that they may bee a pattern unto men,”<seg>1<note type="gloss">Source: <bibl>Charles Butler, <title rend="italic">The Feminine Monarchie</title> (Oxford, 1634): 2</bibl>.</note></seg> Pulter’s bee is greedy, and her “labour” is anything but admirable. Yet comparing Emblem 53 to early modern accounts of bees (both real and metaphorical bees) reveals that Pulter reinforces seventeenth-century knowledge about the characteristics of bees, and that her bee’s deviation from “appropriate” bee-behaviour allows Pulter to emphasize the dangers of solitude, particularly solitude from a community of other women.</p>
                    <p>Bees were a common metaphor, symbol, or analogy in classical and early modern literature, with Shakespeare’s <title rend="italic">Henry V</title> and Milton’s <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title> two familiar examples. Indeed, Pulter would not have been able to use bees as a metaphor without contending with the vast scope of bee literature and bee metaphors that had come before her. Of course, this assumes that Pulter had read “bee literature” and was acquainted with honeybees in some fashion. In his reading of Shakespeare on bees, Richard Grinnell confronts a similar question: how much did Shakespeare know about bees? His answer is worth quoting at length: “Shakespeare keeps bees the way any well-read and urbane writer might have been able to—building his metaphors and analogies from books at hand. Even when he moves beyond the classics, for example, in his description of Hal as a beekeeper willing to kill the bees to get the honey, he is clearly working with material that was common knowledge in his day” (850). Beekeeping during the early modern period was also an occupation and even obligation for both men and women. Treatises on caring for bees are often addressed to both sexes, and women feature prevalently in stories about bees, honey, and hives. William Lawson, writing in 1623, states in his treatise on gardening that he “will not account her any of my good Housewives, that wanteth either Bees or skilfulnesse about them.”<seg>2<note type="gloss"><bibl>William Lawson,<title rend="italic"> The Country Housewifes Garden. Containing Rules for Hearbs and Seeds of common use, with their times and seasons, when to set and sow them. Together With the Husbandry of Bees, published with secrets very necessary for every Housewife […]</title> (London: Printed for Roger Jackson, 1623): 17</bibl>.</note></seg> Pulter would certainly not be unusual if she knew something—or even much—about the care and characteristics of honeybees.</p></note>
                <p>Pulter’s bee (in contrast to the industrious and virtuous bees of most of the literature that predates Emblem 53) is greedy and grasping, and her bee’s struggle against confinement causes her exhaustion and death. According to Nicole A. Jacobs, another outlier in early modern bee imagery is John Milton, who compares the devils in Pandemonium to a swarm of bees in <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title>. In her monograph <title rend="italic">Bees in Early Modern Transatlantic Literature: Sovereign Colony</title>, Jacobs emphasizes the weight of literary tradition that any negative depiction of bees would have to shrug off: “The image of the humming collection [in <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title>] resonates with the early modern reader, trained by tradition to imagine humanity as an orderly hive.”<seg>3<note type="gloss"><bibl>Jacobs, <title rend="italic">Bees in Early Modern Transatlantic Literature: Sovereign Colony</title> (New York: Routledge, 2021): 123</bibl>.</note></seg> The same “tradition” and “train[ing]” would have applied to Pulter’s readers, which perhaps explains why, although the snail (with its patient endurance) seems to be the positive exemplar for the reader, the “moral” of the emblem does not urge readers to imitate the snail necessarily. Instead, Pulter advises that we “think on the snail, the tulip, and the bee” (line 52). Indeed, while the bee causes her own unnecessary death in Pulter’s poem, the common literary symbolism of worker bees in the seventeenth century was so overwhelmingly positive that readers must have resisted, even a little, the idea that they should be the greasy snail rather than the “active Amazonian maid” (line 7).</p>
                <p>If a honey bee is separate from its colony, it is soon to die. In 1657, beekeeper Samuel Purchas wrote baldly, “one Bee, is no Bee.”<seg>4<note type="gloss">Source: <bibl>Purchas, <title rend="italic">A Theatre of Politicall Flying-Insects</title> (London, 1657): 16</bibl>.</note></seg> Joseph Campana quotes from Purchas as well to emphasize the apian–and more general–early modern anxiety with solitude, segments, and fragmentation in the commonwealth. “For bees,” Campana concludes, “singularity is unbearable.”<seg>5<note type="gloss">Source: <bibl>Campana, “The Bee and the Sovereign (II): Segments, Swarms, and the Shakespearean Multitude,” in <title rend="italic">The Return of Theory in Early Modern English Studies</title>, edited by Bryan Reynolds, Paul Cefalu, and Gary Kuchar (New York: Routledge, 2011): 67</bibl>.</note></seg> Keith Botelho summarizes early modern beekeepers’ attitudes towards individual and collective bees: “early modern bee treatises often spoke of bees in the collective, not necessarily concerned with the individual bee (other than the Queen) but rather with the maintenance of the stock of bees in the hives, of the swarm, of the many.”<seg>6<note type="gloss">Source: <bibl>Botelho, “Honey, Wax, and the Dead Bee,” <title rend="italic">Early Modern Culture</title> 11 (2016): 102</bibl>.</note></seg> Not only beekeepers, but also early modern writers of fiction or moral instruction generally referred to bees in the plural, and James Howell’s 1660 <title rend="italic">The Parly of Beasts; or Morphandra Queen of the Inchanted Island</title> is a notable example. In Howell’s dialogues, the characters Morphandra and Pererius speak to a number of animals (who were once human) in turn, beginning with an Otter, then an Ass, an Ape, a Hind, a Mule, a Fox, a Boar, a Wolf, and a Goose. In the first ten sections of the book, the animal interlocutor is singular, but not so in the final dialogue, in which Morphandra and Pererius converse with “<hi rend="italic">a Hive</hi> of Bees” (my emphasis), for bees were thought to exist only in a collective. All this is to say that when Pulter’s bee diverts from her voyage back to her hive, she is doing something unusual and potentially deadly: separating herself from the collective that gives her life.</p>
                <p>Emblem 53 uses a number of means to create and maintain female community, whether real or imagined. The bee is an “Amazonian maid,” which of course places her in the well-known society of Amazons, but it also reminds readers that bees themselves live in a society that is predominantly female. Christina Luckyj and Naimh J. O’Leary assert that “classical models of segregated female communities could serve as code for political protest.”<seg>7<note type="gloss">Source: <bibl>Luckyj and O’Leary, Editor’s Introduction to <title rend="italic">The Politics of Female Alliance in Early Modern England</title> (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2017): 6</bibl>.</note></seg> Natural models–the model of the beehive–could also serve as such a “code,” especially when Pulter compares the bee and snail to Biron, Belisarius, Bajazeth, and Callisthenes. The four men are associated with the military, which may remind readers of the military connotations of bees in early modern England. Butler, for instance, writes that “Besides their Soveraign, the Bees have also subordinate Governours and Leaders, not unfitly resembling Captains and Colonels of Soldiers.<seg>8<note type="gloss">Source: Butler, 6.</note></seg> With her references to women and military might, Pulter may be subtly gesturing towards a political protest, one that gives communities of women classical, natural, and even military power.</p>

These opening lines, with the Amazon reference as a kind of anchor point, transform the morning garden into a female separatist community—a framing with important implications for how we read the rest of the poem. First, framing the bee’s actions within this context connects the labor of collecting nectar to women’s work, which then prompts us to read Pulter’s later references to poisonous herbs (lines 13–14) and “choice extractions” (line 15) as nods to domestic labor. Second, it links Emblem 53 to other writings in which Pulter explores the intimacies that develop within communities of women, most notably the female friendships throughout her prose romance, <title rend="italic">The Unfortunate Florinda</title>.</note></seg>, dressed with radiant light,</rdg>

            <rdg wit="#ae">When she her <seg>virgin beauty<note type="critical">Associating Aurora with virginity, Pulter departs from classical tradition in which Aurora is often aggressively sexualized. Pulter retains some of the figure’s fraught sexual history, though, by drawing on conventional blazon imagery, describing Aurora wrapped in a “silver” robe with “roses” ornamenting her “dewy curls.” This description echoes language from earlier poems in the manuscript dedicated to Aurora: <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="22">To Aurora [1]</ref>, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="26">To Aurora [2]</ref>, and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="34">To Aurora [3]</ref>. “To Aurora [3]” is particularly resonant here. In that earlier poem, Aurora “shakes her dewy curls” and fills the flowers—”each gold-enamelled cup”—with “honeydew” (lines 8–9).

            <rdg wit="#a2">When she her <seg>virgin beauty<note type="critical">Sperrazza points out in her Amplified Edition of Emblem 53 that Pulter unusually but often associates Aurora with virginity. Bees too, during the early modern period, were considered virginal, as Pulter herself emphasizes in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="34">To Aurora [3]</ref>, lines 10-11, and in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="57">Why Must I Thus Forever Be Confined</ref> line 5. The perceived virginity of bees also linked them to the Virgin Mary, which Henry Hawkins explains in his 1633 emblem book, <title rend="italic">Partheneia Sacra</title>. His bee emblem begins with “To Bethlem’s sillie shed, me thinks I see / The <hi rend="italic">Virgin</hi> hasten like a busie Bee,” and ends with “She was the <hi rend="italic">Bee</hi>, the Hive her Sacred Womb” (Hawkins, Parthenia Sacra (London, 1633): lines 1-2; 12). Also during the seventeenth century, the newly-elected Pope Urban VIII heralded himself by means of iconographic bees, iconography that John Milton then used to disparage Charles II (<bibl>Jacobs, <title rend="italic">Bees in Early Modern Transatlantic Literature: Sovereign Colony</title> (New York: Routledge, 2021): 117</bibl>).

At this point in the poem, the bee is behaving exactly as she ought: during the day, bees must fly out of the hive to forage for nectar and pollen. However, Pulter’s bee remains dangerously “out” of the hive as she is enticed by the garden’s beauty. That “Out” is the first word of this line suggests that the bee’s fault is not just endless toil, but also and particularly solitude and estrangement from the community of the hive (See Headnote).</note></seg> flew the active <seg>Amazonian maid<note type="critical">Pulter uses the adjective “Amazonian” to describe the bee in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="12">The Garden</ref> as well (line 43). In the Amplified Edition of that poem, Frances E. Dolan notes on line 43 that “references to bees as ‘Amazonian’ acknowledged that their queen was female, which was not yet widely recognized.” While arguments about the sex of the ruling bee remained animated even into the eighteenth century, already in the mid-seventeenth century it would have been difficult to deny that the queen bee was indeed female. The sex of the queen bee was all but established by Charles Butler’s highly influential bee-keeping treatise, <title rend="italic">The Feminine Monarchy</title>, published in 1609, and again in 1623 and 1634. This is the treatise that almost all later treatises either cited, feted, or challenged. Indeed, Richard R. Prete cites Butler’s text as the turning-point in publications explaining the sex of bees: “Butler’s sound reasoning and empirical observations, in con- junction with the popularity of his book, brought to an end any serious, empirically based debates about the genders of the honey bee castes. From this point on, writers of beekeeping texts would have to recognize these facts, even if only to refute them, if they were to be taken seriously by their audiences.” (<bibl>“Can Females Rule the Hive? The Controversy over Honey Bee Gender Roles in British Beekeeping Texts of the Sixteenth-Eighteenth Centuries.” <title rend="italic">Journal of the History of Biology</title>, 24.1 (1991), 128</bibl>). In 1637, therefore, Richard Remnant’s <title rend="italic">A Discourse or Historie of Bees</title> spends considerable attention on the implication of bees as females. Moreover, in the first bee-keeping manual published after the English Civil War, Samuel Purchas in his 1657 <title rend="italic">A Theatre of Politicall Flying-Insects</title> calls the hive “an Amazonian commonwealth” (London, 33). In 1712, Joseph Warder appeals to a metaphor already established when he entitles his bee-keeping treatise <title rend="italic">The True Amazons: Or The Monarchy of Bees</title>. Pulter is thus hardly bucking tradition or “scientific” knowledge when she calls her bee an “Amazonian maid.”</note></seg>;</rdg>

John Thorley’s 1744 bee treatise <title rend="italic">Melissologia</title>, for instance, hardly breaks new ground when it summarizes and admires the bees’ “loyalty” (7), “concord and unity” (12), “magnanimity or courage” (15), “labour and industry” (23), “patience and innocency” (27), “temperance and sobriety” (29), “chastity” (30), “neatness and decency” (31), “sympathy, and mutual assistance” (32), “sagacity and prudence” (33), and “vigilance and watchfulness” (<bibl>Thorley, <title rend="italic">Melissologia. Or, The Female Monarchy</title> (London, 1744): 33</bibl>). Indeed, “Bees themselves excell all other creatures … in Art, Wisdom, or Foresight, Industry, Valour and Loyalty,” Moses Rusden writes in 1679 (<bibl>Rusden, <title rend="italic">A Further Discovery of Bees</title> (London, 1679): 9</bibl>). In particular, the fact that bees make honey and wax—both useful to humans—makes them especially prized or “crowned,” and thus the fertile bee in the hive is called a “queen.” “Her wisdom’s crowned,” however, cannot refer to only one singular bee, for a bee cannot make honey in isolation. If a bee is prized because it extracts honey from plants, the honor must go to the entire hive, the site of honey production.</note></seg>.</rdg>

Adam calls Eve awake “to mark … how the bee / sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet” (lines 20–25). The noun “extraction” and its verb form “extract” (line 12) had alchemical, medicinal, and culinary connotations in seventeenth-century use. “To extract” is “to obtain (constituent elements, juices, etc.) from a thing or substance by suction, pressure, distillation, or any chemical or mechanical operation” (<bibl>“extract, v.4a,” <title rend="italic">OED Online</title></bibl>).

            <rdg wit="#ae">Then were my <seg>tulips painted<note type="critical">The tulip has special significance in Pulter’s emblem. She not only makes the center of this flower the location for her fable of the bee and snail (as we’re about to see); she also describes the tulip with language that evokes the “tulipmania” of the early seventeenth century: “painted” (here and again in line 27) and “gilded” (line 34). From the 1580’s to the mid-1630’s, tulips were a prized and elusive commodity, famous in aristocratic gardens and still life paintings, but notoriously difficult to study and classify given their infinite variety. In <bibl>John Gerard’s <title rend="italic">The Herbal, or General History of Plants</title> (London, 1597)</bibl>, Gerard describes the tulips as “a strange and foreign flower” and emphasizes that it is impossible to catalogue all of its varieties: “each new yeare bringeth forth new plants of sundry colours, not before seene” (<bibl>[London, 1597], Text Creation Partnership digital edition, <title rend="italic">Early English Books Online</title>, pages 137–140</bibl>). The craze surrounding the tulip culminated in the Dutch “tulipmania” of the 1630’s, when the price of tulip bulbs inflated drastically (the most expensive specimens went for around 5,000 guilders). We might speculate that Pulter has this recent cultural phenomenon in mind when she describes the tulips first as luxurious garden accessories (“painted in their pride”) and then as the bee’s “painted prison.” See this poem’s Curation (<ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Pulter’s Garden</ref>) for examples of Gerard’s tulip woodcuts and Dutch still life paintings featuring the flower. For more on the tulip in early modern English contexts, see <bibl>Anna Pavord’s <title rend="italic">The Tulip: The Story of a Flower That Has Made Men Mad</title> (Bloomsbury, 1999)</bibl>, especially chapter 3.</note></seg> in their pride,</rdg>
            <rdg wit="#a2">Then were my <seg>tulips<note type="critical">John Parkinson writes in his 1629 gardening treatise, “There are not only divers kindes of Tulipas, but sundry diversities of colours in them, found out in these later dayes by many the [sic] searchers of natures varieties, which have not formerly been observed: our age being more delighted in the search, curiosity, and rarieites of these pleasant delights, then [sic] any age I thinke before. But indeede, this flower, above many other, deserves his true commendations and acceptance with all lovers of these beauties, both for the stately aspect, and for the admirable varietie of colours, that daily doe arise in them, farre beyond all other plants that grow” (<bibl>Parkinson, <title rend="italic">Paradisi in sole paradisus terrestris</title> (London, 1629): 45</bibl>). Moreover, as Benedict S. Robinson identifies, tulips were first exported from Turkey to Europe in the late sixteenth century, and, he argues, “the tulip could also be taken to embody an ‘orientalizing’ of English tastes, an errant desire for exotic plants that rooted itself right into the soil” (<bibl>Robinson, “Green Seraglios: Tulips, Turbans, and the Global Market,” <title rend="title">Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies</title> 9.1 (2009): 96</bibl>). The bee’s attraction to the tulip, then, demonstrates her “covetousness,” but also her relatable, commonplace, and even human interest in the beautiful and exotic flower.</note></seg> painted in their pride,</rdg>

While bees were usually considered selfless and self-sacrificing –Moses Rusden praises their “loyalty”, for example—Pulter’s bee is greedy. Another notable example of a “bad bee” appears in John Bunyan’s 1686 <title rend="italic">A Book for Boys and Girls: Or, Country Rhimes For Children</title>, which is filled with moral lessons in the form of naked emblems, not unlike the naked emblems Pulter employs. Bunyan’s emblem “Upon the Bee” starts innocuously enough: “The Bee goes out and Honey home doth bring; / And some who seek that Hony find a sting. / [N]ow wouldst thou have the Hony and be free / [Fr]om stinging; in the first place kill the Bee” (10). The following “Comparison” is startling, especially in contrast to the nigh-universal praise afforded the bee by Bunyan’s contemporaries: “This Bee an Emblem truly is of sin / Whose Sweet unto a many death hath been. / [N]ow would’st have Sweet from sin, and yet not dye, / [D]o thou in the first place mortifie” (<bibl>Bunyan, <title rend="italic">A Book for Boys and Girls</title> (London, 1686): 10</bibl>).</note></seg> <seg>espied<note type="gloss">saw</note></seg>,</rdg>

In medieval and early modern art, the snail was often linked to the Virgin Mary as a symbol of virginity. <bibl>Francesco del Cossa’s <title rend="italic">Annunciation</title></bibl>, for example, includes a snail in the painting’s foreground, positioned directly in front of Mary as she receives the news of her immaculate conception. Geneticist Steve Jones offers a useful account of the history of the snail as a symbol of “sex, age, and death” in his lecture, <bibl>“Snails in Art and the Art of Snails” (2014), available online through the Museum of London</bibl>. By the time Pulter was writing, the snail was increasingly cited in debates about the role of reproduction in the plant and animal worlds. Several decades after Pulter’s death in 1678, Dutch anatomist Jan Swammerdam proved that snails were hermaphrodites (<bibl><title rend="italic">Bybel der Natuure</title>, Leiden, 1737</bibl>). Before that point, as historian of science Domenico Bertolini Meli outlines, hermaphrodites were seen to be rare occurrences, even monsters. Swammerdam’s findings became the basis for arguments on the natural occurrence of hermaphrodites in nature (<bibl>Meli, “Of Snails and Horsetails: Anatomical Empiricism in the Early Modern Period,” <title rend="italic">Early Science and Medicine</title> 18.4/5 (2013): 435–452</bibl>).</note></seg>, who slid about to see</rdg>

As Victoria Burke notes in her Amplified Edition of <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="3">Aurora [1]</ref>, the feminized Delia, as opposed to Delius, could be a transcription error, but Pulter does use Delia to refer to Apollo in several other poems, including <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="1">The Eclipse</ref> and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="12">The Garden, or the Contention of Flowers</ref>. Given this emblem’s interrogation of gender, we might read Pulter’s slippage here as an invitation. As the female bee (“the active Amazonian maid”) dies and the poem shifts to a cluster of male figures in its closing lines, is Pulter’s switch from Aurora to Delia (and, perhaps, from Delius to Delia) meant to both mark and trouble this transition?</note></seg> <seg>diffused<note type="gloss">spread out</note></seg> his rays;</rdg>

Indeed, Apollo is the first male character in the poem; Aurora, the bee, the tulip, and the snail are all female. While the feminine Aurora brought life and beauty to the world, Apollo’s “rays” reveal exhaustion and death for the bee.</note></seg> diffused his rays;</rdg>

Where the bee “flew,” the snail “slid.” While the bee is “active,” the snail is “unctuous.” Pulter may be playing up the positive characteristics of the bee to acknowledge its commonplace association with wisdom, virtue, etc. If Pulter’s readers—because of traditional representations and Pulter’s appealing depiction—sympathize with the bee, perhaps they are more likely to take personally the warnings of Emblem 53.</note></seg> the <seg>snail<note type="critical">Again, Bunyan’s <title rend="italic">A Book for Boys and Girls</title> provides helpful context for Pulter’s instructive snail. His emblem “Upon the Snail” is notably lengthier and more intimate than his scathing indictment of the bee: “She goes but softly, but she goeth sure, / She stumbles not, as stronger Creatures do: / Her Journeys shorter, so she may endure, / Better than they which do much further go. / She makes no noise, but stilly seizeth on / The Flow’r or Herb, appointed for her food: / The which she quietly doth feed upon, / While others range, and gare, but find no good. / And tho she doth but very softly go, / How ever ’tis not fast, nor slow, but sure; / And certainly they that do travel so, / The prize they do aim at, they do procure” (63-64). The subsequent “Comparison” is equally encouraging: “Although they seem not much to stire, less go, / For Christ that hunger, or from Wrath, that flee; / Yet what they seek for, quickly thy come to, / Tho it doth seem the farthest off to be. / One Act of Faith doth bring them to that Flow’r, / They so long for, that they may eat and live; / Which to attain is not in others Pow’r / Tho for it a King’s Ransom they would give. / Then let none faint, nor be at all dismaid, / That Life by Christ do seek, they shall not fail / To have it, let them nothing be afraid; / The Herb, and Flow’r is eaten by the Snail” (<bibl>Bunyan, <title rend="italic">A Book for Boys and Girls</title> (London, 1686): 64</bibl>). George Wither’s <title rend="italic">A Collection of Emblemes Ancient and Moral</title> also praises the snail for its patience and tenacity. Wither writes in Book 1, Emblem 11: “If they would contemplate the slow-pac’d Snaile; / Or, this our Hieroglyphicke looke into: / For, thence we learne, that Perseverance brings / Large Workes to end, though slowly they creep on; / And, that Continuance perfects many things, / Which seeme, at first, unlikely to be done” (<bibl>Wither, <title rend="italic">A Collection of Emblems</title> (London: 1635): 11</bibl>). Pulter’s snail then, unlike her bee, aligns with seventeenth-century emblematics.</note></seg>; the bee did fainting lie</rdg>

Second, when the bee finds herself in another, albeit weaker, female community—she, the tulip, and the snail are all gendered female in the poem—she does not function as a helpful part of that group either.

The “impatient” bee struggles against her “painted prison” (line 27), while the patient snail “see[s] no hope” and “lay[s] … down to rest” (line 30). In the poem’s final motto, Pulter reminds us of the snail, tulip, and bee fable (“if no hope of liberty you see, / think on the snail, the tulip, and the bee” [lines 51–52]), but the lessons of the two mottoes are slightly different—enough to invite some critical thinking on the part of Pulter’s reader. This motto focuses on destiny, while the poem’s final motto foregrounds liberty. Who are the “impatient spirits” Pulter addresses with this lesson? Who is the “you” of the final motto’s direct address?</note></seg>.</rdg>

As I noted in my headnote, this cast of characters marks a significant gender shift from the female-centric opening of the poem. But this phrase is also formally noteworthy. Rather than using just one or two comparisons to illustrate her point, Pulter here offers an extensive catalogue of examples: “so stout Biron” (line 39), “when Belisarius” (line 41), “so miscre’nt Bajazeth” (line 43), and “when wise Callisthenes” (line 47). The anaphoric “so’s” and “when’s” of these final lines, very typical of Pulter’s emblems, signal her strategic accumulation of these examples. Again, how might Pulter be using her poems to explore how poetic language signifies? See my headnote for more on this question.</p><p>Charles de Gontaut, duc de Biron, was a sixteenth-century French military leader eventually involved in conspiracies against the French crown. He was jailed and beheaded for treason in 1602. Alice Eardley cites George Chapman’s play, <title rend="italic">The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron, Marshall of France</title> (1608) as one possible source for Pulter’s anecdote here. Biron was “notorious for his arrogance,” Eardley notes, and in Chapman’s play his sword is removed from him, “treatment he vigorously resists.” See <bibl><title rend="italic">Poems, Emblems, and The Unfortunate Florinda</title>, Ed.

            <rdg wit="#a2">So stout <seg>Biron<note type="critical">Biron, Belisarius, Bajazeth, and Callisthenes, all identified in the Elemental Edition of the poem, are exemplars of human responses to imprisonment and hardship; Biron and Bajazeth react as does the bee, and Belisarius and Callisthenes demonstrate the patience of the snail. The four men are particularly apropos comparisons to the bee because all of them are subordinates to a master. Honeybees, both now and in the seventeenth century, are communal creatures, which Samuel Purchas emphasizes when he writes “<foreign rend="italic">una Apis, nulla Apis, one Bee is no Bee</foreign>” (16). He drives home the point: “A Bee, like a man cannot live alone, if shee be alone, shee dies” (17).  The very fact that the bee of Pulter’s poem is an individual apart from the hive puts her in a position of rebellion and danger. In this case, the bee, tulip, and snail are subordinate to the “influence” of the sun, just as Biron, Belisarius, Bajazeth, and Callisthenes were subject to the rulings (or whims) of their masters.</note></seg> in prison was enraged,</rdg>

Jacobs identifies Pulter’s primary audience for her manuscript as her daughters (133), although Pulter appears to have imagined a future, more general readership as well (<bibl>Jacobs, <title rend="italic">Bees in Early Modern Transatlantic Literature: Sovereign Colony</title> (New York: Routledge, 2021): 132</bibl>). Indeed, all people could easily be tempted to behave as the “covetous” bee, “for it may well bee said, he is not humane, that is not allured with [herbs and flowers]” (<bibl>Parkinson, <title rend="italic">Paradisi in sole paradisus terrestris</title> (London, 1629): sig**3V</bibl>). Yet if Emblem 53, like <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="2">The Invitation into the Country, 1647</ref>, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="56">A Dialogue Between Two Sisters</ref>, and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="38">To My Dear Jane, Margaret, and Penelope Pulter, They Being at London, I at Broadfield</ref> is written expressly to Pulter’s daughters, the poem’s emphasis on community—and female community at that—becomes all the more pointed. Why does the bee die? Because it was alone. “Come, my dear children, to this lonely place,” Pulter begins “To My Dear Jane, Margaret, and Penelope Pulter, They Being at London, I at Broadfield.” “An Invitation into the Country, 1647” opens in a similar vein: “Dear daughters, come, make haste away.”Finally, “A Dialogue Between Two Sisters” concludes with the sisters’ resolve to “go to our sad mother: she’s alone” (line 54). The appropriate response for female grief is therefore female community. Pulter, however, ups the ante in Emblem 53: separation from female community results not just in grief, but in death.</note></seg> see</rdg>
