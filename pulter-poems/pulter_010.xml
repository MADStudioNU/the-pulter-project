Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

                  <note type="headnote">Written two years after the death of her daughter Jane, Pulter offers a personal elegy that intermixes Christian and classical references. Addressed to other parents, the poem laments the fact that the passing of time, marked by seasonal changes in the natural world and the movement of planets, has not lessened the intensity of her grief, which is not conventionally resolved with Christian affirmation of the afterlife here. Writing in the genre of the “child-loss” poem, Pulter’s tenor is unusually personal; it vividly narrates the moment of Jane’s death by contrasting the purity of her soul with physical signs of illness: the red blotches of fever akin to red roses on a bed of lilies or the blood of a wounded deer in the snow. The poem concludes with the speaker poignantly imagining herself as Niobe, the classical figure who turned to stone for excessive pride in her children, someone whose petrification represents the lifelessness the speaker feels in her state of grief.</note>

                  <p>This poem, written two years after the death of Pulter’s adult daughter Jane, offers a fascinating perspective on maternal grief. The passage of time and the Christian concepts of heaven and resurrection have done little to assuage the speaker’s pain, and she seeks a more satisfying expression of her grief by experimenting with cultural allusions and by combining conventions of child-loss elegies with those of Petrarchan love poetry. Many seventeenth-century poets writing about the death of a child found solace in Christianity as they reframed grief as divine grace. Many other English poets imitated Petrarch, a fourteenth-century Italian poet whose male speaker expressed unrequited love for a beautiful but inaccessible woman. Pulter’s elegy builds upon both traditions. It describes a mother’s love for her daughter in Petrarchan terms as its speaker refuses to be consoled.</p>
                    <p>The poem is also noteworthy for revealing a work in progress. Like all of Pulter’s poetry, it survives in a single manuscript. In the manuscript, this poem’s line 44 is crossed out and replaced with nine new lines, and because these changes are written in the same scribal hand as the rest of the manuscript, it is likely that they are authorially sanctioned. I have edited two versions of the poem to enable readers to compare Pulter’s early and revised endings; this version is the early one. The salient differences can be found in the final eight lines here and the final sixteen in “Version B: Pulter’s revised text.” Unlike the revised version, which alludes to Royalist lament, the early version presented here does not connect maternal grief to contemporary politics, and it dwells a little less on Jane’s physical body and the cyclical nature of grief.</p>
                  <p>To prepare this poem for a wide range of readers, I have modernized spelling, punctuation, and capitalization to conform to standard American usage, as well as expanded all contractions. I have glossed archaic definitions and confusing syntax, identified allusions, and alerted readers when the manuscript’s original spelling is especially worth considering. In my notes, I aim not to direct interpretation in a restrictive way, but to facilitate multiple interpretations of the poem by highlighting its engagement with genre, myth, and religion.</p>

This version is the revised one; it incorporates the nine added lines (43-52), which adapt a popular image from both Petrarchan and Royalist poetry to compare Jane to a hunted deer. These new lines transform the poem into a subtle Royalist lament, and, in repeating phrases and images from other parts of the poem, they amplify the speaker’s obsession with Jane’s red rash as she tries to explain to others the devastating physical destruction of Jane’s illness.</p>

                    <rdg wit="#a2">Or as a stately <seg>hart<note type="critical">A male deer. Pulter plays on a familiar “hart”/“heart” pun in describing the deer. This pun and that of “deer”/”dear” (see the poem’s title, which labels Jane “dear”) appear frequently in English Petrarchan poetry. Hunting and hunted stags were also common Royalist tropes (see John Denham’s “Cooper’s Hill”). Pulter’s <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="90">This Flying Fish (Emblem 25)</ref>) makes the political allusion explicit when it repeats nearly verbatim the description of the hunted deer in this poem and analogizes it to the late Charles I. Peter Davidson argues persuasively in “Green Thoughts: Marvell’s Gardens; Clues to Two Curious Puzzles” (<title rend="italic">Times Literary Supplement</title> 3 December 1999, 14-15) that these inserted lines allude to Marvell’s “Nymph Complaining for the Death of Her Fawn.” Marvell’s own allusions date “Nymph” to no earlier than 1647, and Ross (<title rend="italic">Women, Poetry, and Politics</title>, 151) notes the tight time frame in dating both Pulter’s and Marvell’s poems to 1647. Yet although Pulter seems to have written this poem in 1647, she might have revised it (and inserted these lines, inspired by Marvell) at a later date.</note></seg> to death pursued</rdg>

The changed pronouns might simply fix a scribal error because the poem identifies the deer as male (a hart), or the revision might reflect a change in approach. If using feminine pronouns, the lines imagine Jane as the deer; in a grotesque image, it is Jane who stumbles, teary-eyed, after an arrow strikes her breast. As the masculine pronouns make the entire section more clearly into a simile (Jane only reminds us of a hunted deer and is not actually shot with an arrow), they enable readers to make broader poetic and political connections, including a possible allusion to Charles I.</note></seg> eyes with tears bedewed,</rdg>
