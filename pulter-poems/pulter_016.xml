                        The aim of the elemental edition to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers,
                        which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and
                        punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might
                        otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not
                        modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote
                        aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by
                        Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to
                        allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various
                        possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure
                        material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford
                        Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s
                        edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The
                        result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.

Where modernisation would affect form, priority has been given to the integrity of the poem’s formal features (so, for instance, verb endings -est and -eth have been retained unmodernised; where the meter requires it, the verb ending -ed is accented, e.g., “Then shall thy blessèd influence”). Nouns have been capitalized only when there is clear personification. The notes provide information essential to understanding the poem, while the Headnote aims to stimulate readers’ own interpretations through suggesting literary or historical contexts, possible influences, comparable poems (by Pulter and by her predecessors and peers) and relevant critical arguments.</note></rdg>

                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">In this poem, Pulter experiments with form, writing in iambic tetrameter triplets (three rhyming lines). Her subject matter is devotional: the first part of the poem uses astronomical and cosmological imagery to imagine the physical dissolution of the universe and matter if God were to withdraw his sustenance. The poem turns then to welcome this dissolution of human and earthly forms, as the speaker imagines a personal transmutation in which her basic elements (air, dust, tears) swirl redemptively into the heavens. Transmuted into a fiery comet in the skies, she hopes to serve as an emblem for other women to understand that penance can secure eternal salvation.</note></rdg>
                <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">
                  <p>A poem written in the mid-seventeenth century with the title ‘The Revolution’ might invite political interpretation, but this was not the word’s primary meaning in the period and Pulter keeps the astronomical and spiritual senses firmly in the foreground. (On Pulter’s use of “revolution” see also <ref target="/" corresp="48" type="pp-poem-ref">Immense Fount of Truth</ref> and <ref target="/" corresp="47" type="pp-poem-ref">Why Art Thou Sad at the Approach of Night</ref>.) Taking its cue from God’s creation of everything, this poem goes on to explore a darker possibility: the withdrawal of God’s light. Pulter combines her modern, Copernican and Galilean, understanding of the universe with that of Genesis. The scientific and spiritual are combined even at the level of individual words: Pulter describes God “circumvolv[ing]” everything, a verb that can be transitive or intransitive. So God both turns everything on earth (creates the revolutions of the planets identified in contemporary cosmology) and encircles it (in that he gives life to everything).</p>
                  <p>Like <ref target="/" corresp="65" type="pp-poem-ref">The Hope</ref>, this poem explores the prospect of physical dissolution—of death—and rejoices at the possibility of spiritual rebirth. While this process of violent purification is enabled by God, Pulter imagines it through the language of both atomism and of alchemy. The question “Who can Thy infinite power rehearse / Which didst create this universe / And canst to atoms it disperse?” harnesses atomist thinking to a Christian account of creation, and defies the suggestion that it is possible ever fully to explain (“rehearse”) God’s power. The prospect of a God for whom annihilation is “easy” evokes the wrathful Old Testament God, and Pulter also brings in alchemical processes here. She welcomes physical annihilation, saying that it would purify her to a matter-less, formless soul (ll. 25-27), and the verb she uses twice for this process, “calcine”, is alchemical, meaning to purify a substance to quicklime by burning it. When Pulter’s speaker herself becomes a burning light (ll. 49-51) she considers using her own power, in turn, to “calcine” the mortal world but realises she does not have the ability to “refine” it; alchemical processes fail where God’s power does not. The poem does, though, claim the potency of tears as redeeming and refining. The speaker turns defiantly to “you” (distinguished from the “Thou”, God, that the poem previously addressed), perhaps the reader, who might “scorn repentant tears” and argues that her tears will “rear”, or raise up, her dust. (In Andrew Marvell’s "Eyes and Tears" he praises weeping, and especially the tears of Mary Magdalene.)</p>
                  <p>The prospect of physical annihilation and spiritual rebirth allows a soaring exhilaration: “For love and zeal my breast inflames, / Then follow, all heroic dames, / It will immortalise your fames.” In other poems, Pulter’s speaker forbids herself such flight, as for example in <ref target="/" corresp="30" type="pp-poem-ref">The Center</ref>: “Halloo, my thoughts! To native earth descend; / For thy ambition in the dust must end”, ll. 37-8. The otherwise ungendered speaker in "The Revolution" clearly calls upon a female community here, one of “heroic dames”. Despite the difference in genre and religious intent, this idea of heroic women and Pulter’s fantasy of burning power (“I a thousand worlds might burn”) might invite comparison with <bibl><author>Margaret Cavendish’s</author> fantasy, in <title rend="italic">The Description of a New World, called the Blazing-World</title> (printed with her <title rend="italic">Observations Upon Experimental Philosophy</title>, 1666)</bibl>. Like Pulter’s “The Center,” this poem adopts the geometry of the new astronomy, its potent visual landscape of spheres and orbits, to think about God as the sun-like light-giving centre of the universe around which the planets revolve. The poem also enacts its own revolution by turning thoughts of annihilation and sorrow into a renewal of faith and hope. The poem’s rhymed triplets may also intensify the sense of revolution as some of the same rhyme sounds and even words are returned to within the poem.</p>
