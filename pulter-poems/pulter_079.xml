                        The aim of the elemental edition to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers,
                        which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and
                        punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might
                        otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not
                        modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote
                        aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by
                        Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to
                        allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various
                        possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure
                        material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford
                        Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s
                        edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The
                        result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.

The retention of original spelling and punctuation has the potential to get us closer to the choices made by the poet and scribe, but some scribal details (such as abbreviations) do not seem substantive or meaning-bearing and run the risk of alienating a modern reader.</note></rdg>

In this beast fable, a vain male porcupine swaggers along shooting his quills and insulting a female tortoise, who hides motionless in her shell. When a cart passes by and the riders laugh at the animals, the porcupine turns his weaponry on them, but the riders drive him away with stones and whips. Although their cart rolls over the tortoise, she is protected by her shell. The injured porcupine then seems to seize control of the emblem by moralizing what he has learned about the value of non-retaliation, a lesson the speaker echoes with her own expressed aim of leaving retribution in God’s hands. The humility and apparent pacifism of such a vow stands in marked contrast to the final line’s confident invocation of divine vengeance upon the speaker’s unnamed “oppressors.”</note></rdg>

In <title rend="italic">The historie of serpents. Or, The second booke of liuing creatures</title> (1608), Edward Topsell describes the tortoise (pp. 281-287). For the most part the animal is referred to throughout the description as “he,” but in three cases the tortoise is a “she.” In the first, Topsell tells the story of Jupiter inviting all of the animals to a banquet. The tortoise came late and when asked why, she said that she found her own house to be the most excellent. In anger, Jupiter affixed her house permanently onto her back (p. 283). A second story describes Pliny’s version of the advice of the Roman Flaminius to the Achaeans. He urged them not to try to conquer the island of Zacynthii, because just like the tortoise is safe when she is within her shell, and vulnerable when she puts out a limb, so the Achaeans would be similarly at risk (pp. 283-284). And finally, Topsell notes that “Alciatus hath a witty Emblem of a Torteyse to expresse a good huswife, and that the fame of her vertues, spreadeth much further then eyther beautie or riches.” The last half of the poem in question reads, “Such is the shape that Phidias did me frame, / And bade me goe resemble women kind, / To teach them silence, and in house remaine, / Such pictures vnderneath my feete you find” (p. 284). The association in the first and third of these stories is of women with domestic space. While Pulter did not necessarily read Topsell, the writer Anne Southwell did. On one of the later pages of her manuscript miscellany she quotes several passages from Topsell’s works (Folger Shakespeare Library MS V.a.198, fol. 68r-v). Under the heading “of the land Tortiss or Turtle” she tells the story of Jupiter and the tortoise, but changes the gender of the animal from female to male: “Iupiter asking him why he stayed so long, he reply[ed] his owne house gaue him most honnor, Iupiter being angrie a’iudged him that he should still carrie his house vpon his back.” See <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Early Modern Tortoises</ref> for full transcriptions of these passages.</note></seg> oft, and <seg>Spurting many a Quill<note type="critical">The porcupine was believed to be able to shoot his quills like arrows. Pliny’s <title rend="italic">The historie of the world</title>, translated by Philemon Holland (1601, 1634, and 1635), to which Pulter makes reference elsewhere, compares the “Porkpen” to the urchin or hedge-hog: “but the Porkpen hath the longer sharp pointed quilles, and those, when he stretcheth his skin, he sendeth and shooteth from him” (book 8, chapter 35, p. 215).

And therefore in this, the Torteyse is more happy then the Crocodile, or any other such Beast” (p. 282). Both the loaded cart and the happiness of the tortoise figure in Pulter’s emblem. Ben Jonson’s comedy <title rend="italic">Volpone or The Fox</title> makes good use of a tortoise shell in the punishment of Sir Politic Would-Be in act 5, scene 4. Peregrine, the English traveler, has been assaulted in the street by Sir Politic’s wife and so decides to seek revenge by pretending that spies have come to arrest him. Sir Politic decides to take cover in a tortoise shell that he happens to have in his living room. When the spies (really merchants Peregrine has enlisted) begin to torment him, Peregrine says, “Nay, you may strike him, sir, and tread upon him. He’ll bear a cart.” <hi rend="italic">First Merchant</hi>: “What, to run over him?” <hi rend="italic">Peregrine</hi>: “Yes.” (5.4.66-67; <title rend="italic">The Norton Anthology of English Literature</title>, edited by Stephen Greenblatt et al., <num type="ordinal" value="9">9<hi rend="sup">th</hi></num> ed., vol.
