All such instances are treated instead using the ORIG and REG tags. (See below.)</p>
          <p>Corrections and annotations made within the scope of the original document either by its original authors, owners, and/or transcribers are noted using ADD tags.

            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

          <rdg wit="#ee">
              <note type="headnote">Notoriety: this is the focus of Pulter’s emblem, which rehearses the story of men whose ambitious drive for fame led to their destruction. The imaginative geography of this emblem stretches across ancient Greece, Syria, Persia, Babylon, Jerusalem, Gallic Northern Europe, and contemporary Ireland, unearthing a vast array of examples of impiety and sacrilege. While the last part of the poem focuses on the just deserts that anti-heroes such as Cambyses, Belshazzar, and Brennus suffered, the poem begins with the more particular conundrum of how the drive for fame can twist into notoriety instead: the very desire to be commemorated morphs into the curse of not being forgotten as a villain. Pulter’s one mention of a <hi rend="italic">woman</hi> seeking fame is, unusually, herself, offered as a counterexample to the powerful male rulers she mentions. Why is seeking “splendent fame” valid for a poet who hopes to embody the role of “Hadassah” (Queen Esther from the Bible, and Pulter’s chosen pseudonym for her authorship)? Maybe the poem belies a concern about authorial ambition: if choosing between notoriety and oblivion, she states, the choice is clear—she does not wish to join the ranks of the famed criminals whose legendary status the poem perpetuates. The limited circulation of Pulter’s poems, their relegation to oblivion for hundreds of years, and her emergence as a poet later in time makes her reflections on fame and oblivion especially meaningful. </note>
