            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

              <p>
                Poem 39 has some interesting choices for the editor and readers, both because of the particularities of the manuscript (there are two corrections that have a significant effect on the meaning of the lines around them), and because of the choices required by modernization. Because this is a poem about the quest for (and joys of) knowledge (see the Headnote for this amplified edition), I took these decisions as an editorial challenge: how can we <hi rend="italic">know</hi> what the final version of this poem is meant be? How would we translate the poem’s fantasy of total knowledge to editorial fantasies of mastery?
              </p>
              <p>
                The poem’s answer, of course, is that in our world, this fantasy of knowledge is just that: a fantasy. I have therefore made editorial choices where I see fit, but have also created “ghost” visualizations of what other interesting options there are, not burying these choices in a textual apparatus or in notes only, but keeping them on the page for readers to see and consider.<seg>1<note type="critical">1. For a project exploring the ways digital forms might help us visualize variants, see Alan Galey’s <ref target="//individual.utoronto.ca/alangaley/visualizingvariation/animated.html" type="new-window-url">“Visualizing Variation”</ref> project.</note></seg> Those ghost options appear in grey above the choice that replaced them, but, like the poem reminds us, even the most still and motionless buried corpses will not always stay buried: “The sleeping dust will rise and speak” (l. 13). I explain my choices and what is at stake in those editorial decisions in footnotes. In a poem about knowledge, it is best to have as much information as possible, so my notes also include information about the choices made in previous editions, which are cited in the following abbreviated forms:

                Quotations from other Pulter poems are from Eardley’s edition, and are cited by line number. In addition, any Biblical quotations are from the King James Bible of 1611 (<title rend="italic">The Holy Bible, conteyning the Old Testament, and the New / newly translated out of the originall tongues, and with the former translations diligently compared and reuised, by His Maiesties speciall comandement; appointed to be read in churches</title> [London: by Robert Barker, printer to the Kings most Excellent Maiestie, 1611]), and are cited by chapter and verse.

              <p>
                Throughout, I have modernized the text’s spelling and capitalization to concur with the <title rend="italic">Oxford English Dictionary Online</title> (hereafter <title rend="italic">OED</title>) headwords; for example, since “embryon” exists as a headword in the <title rend="italic">OED</title>, I have not modernized it to “embryo.” I have also expanded poetic abbreviations where such expansions would not affect the meter for a modern reader. For example, I expanded “sublim’d” into “sublimed,” as a modern reader would naturally read that word with two syllables. In instances where a final “ed” in the manuscript seems to suggest an additional syllable, I have modernized as “èd” (for example, the manuscript’s “Loathed,” pronounced with two syllables for metrical purposes, became modernized as “loathèd”). I have also modernized punctuation, particularly attempting, in the process, to call attention to the structure of the poem’s argument, though all parentheses in the poem are from the manuscript. Notes gloss difficult words and sentences, provide references to echoes in Pulter’s and other works, and call attention to interesting textual and interpretive ambiguities.

              <note type="headnote">How is an embryo like a corpse? Both are models, in womb or tomb, of patience with cramped quarters—not a quality Pulter herself apparently possessed, since she often rails against her own sequestered state. In tetrameter lines by turns terse and lively, the speaker here alternately lambastes her soul for seeking freedom from this world and offers encouraging analogies of the eventual freeing of other beings once impeded by material bonds. She then envisions her soul’s flight to its celestial place of birth after her own bodily death. Although the pep-talk might work for the soul, it seems to worry the speaker, who seeks assurance that her soul will return to escort her to heaven (somewhat hilariously, she fears sleeping through the trumpeting of the Last Judgment). This reunion of speaker and soul is identified with their mutual perfection, in which their knowledge of worldly mysteries grows clear: transforming griefs to joys, elucidating everything from astronomy to politics, and reuniting them with both friends and a reciprocated knowledge of “[t]he eternal essence.”</note>

                  At first glance, “The Perfection of Patience and Knowledge” seems to be an extended riff on 1 Corinthians 13:12. Where the Biblical text says, “now I know in part, but then shall I know even as also I am known,” the poem concludes with the fantasy that after the Last Judgment, “we shall know (without which all is none) / The eternal essence, even as we are known” (ll. 58–59). What kind of knowledge, exactly, is promised in these lines is a question throughout the poem. After her soul “jogs” her awake for the Final Judgment, they (the speaker of the poem and her soul) will be refined, while the rest of the world is burned to ashes; “then we shall know” (l. 32), she promises to her soul, a variety of things, from astrology to astronomy to alchemy. The poem imaginatively inhabits the moment of the Last Judgment not in order to think about sin or salvation, but to indulge in the fantasy of total knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, the poem also challenges its own fantasy of achieving scientific knowledge: the knowledge of scientific fields gestured to in lines 30–53 seems to be different from the knowledge of the “eternal essence” promised by line 59, or even the love or charity that is the core subject of 1 Corinthians 13.<seg>1<note type="critical">See the curation <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Reading (and Transforming) Biblical Sources</ref> for a full transcription of 1 Corinthians 13, to put Pulter’s reading in its Biblical context.</note></seg> Indeed, Pulter claims in line 55 that the ultimate knowledge of God will make the cosmological research questions of the poem’s middle “prove toys” (l. 55). Against the ending, Sarah Hutton has argued that the poem is entirely invested in the scientific questions of its own middle: “The anticipated re-union with the divine after death, hardly figures in the main body of the poem—not until the last line. The knowledge described in the poem is entirely secular, specifically cosmological.”<seg>2<note type="critical">Sara Hutton, “Hester Pulter (c. 1596–1678). A Woman Poet and the New Astronomy,” <ref target="https://journals.openedition.org/episteme/729" type="new-window-url"><title rend="italic">Etudes Epistémè</title></ref> 14 (2008), 10.</note></seg> How you understand the poem’s sudden turn away from astronomy to the divine knowledge offered by St. Paul in 1 Corinthians radically changes your sense of the ultimate argument of the poem. In 1 Corinthians we are told that “whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part …” (1 Corinthians 13:8–9). Is this a poem about scientific knowledge, or about forsaking the partial knowledge offered by worldly things for the more perfect knowledge (and love) of God?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Or is it about something else? The poem starts, after all, in a totally different place again: with an exhortation to her soul to wait more patiently for the death of the body, and a reflection on the natural physical dissolution of all matter. The three disjunctive parts of the poem—on the soul’s relationship to the body and resurrection (ll. 1–29); on scientific knowledges (ll. 30–53); on the knowledge of God (ll. 54–59)—are set up for the reader as a kind of puzzle, “a maze we now live under” (l. 33) that both astounds us (“a maze” could mean a sense of amazement),<seg>3<note type="critical"><title rend="italic">OED</title>, s.v. “maze, n.” For a comparable reading of Donne’s disjunctive poetic methods, see Liza Blake, “Lyric and Scientific Epistemologies: Bacon and Donne,” in <title rend="italic">Gathering Force: Early Modern British Literature in Transition, 1557–1623</title>, volume I, ed. Kristen Poole and Lauren Shohet (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2019): 171–83, esp. 177–83.</note></seg> and invites us to solve its structure. The poem demands, with these elaborate turns of thought, that we read across and connect all three parts, partly through repetition and careful balancing of images. The first part begins by training you to watch for such patterns, listing four instances of matter in its potential (the unhatched egg; the unborn embryo) and then in its actualization (the chirping bird, the infant freed from the womb). But the repetitions stretch across sections as well: the “sleeping dust” of the corpse (l. 12) piles into the “dunghill globe of earth” (l. 20) that the soul escapes, only to return as the “orbs of wonder” (l. 32) in the second part. Those orbs of wonder that receive so much attention in the second part are themselves both actual globes (perhaps also dunghills, upon closer inspection), and mythological and astrological figures.
                </p>
                <p>Perhaps the answer to all these repetitions, and to the questions the poem raises about its own hybridity, is patience. Despite the fact that the poem has received most attention for its scientific middle, the poem is not called just “The Perfection of Knowledge,” but “The Perfection of Patience and Knowledge”; the poem asks you to sit with it, to contemplate it, to go back and re-read as images and even words change meaning with each repetition and in different contexts (surely the “know” of line 32 cannot mean the same thing as the “know” of line 56, which is different again than the one in line 68). Perhaps the knowledge at stake is not just the science of the middle, or the theology of the end, but a kind of training in patient and careful thought, through the exploration of poetic repetition and form. Perhaps this patience is a form of the charity, or love, for which 1 Corinthians 13 advocates.

These lines are an echo of Pulter’s earlier poem <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="6">Universal Dissolution</ref>: “Those glorious flowers … / … hang their heads and weep / ’Cause in their causes they so soon must sleep. / So man to his first principles must turn …” (ll. 11, 13–15). In this earlier poem, where “cause” is a repeated word, it is clear that causes represent both potential as well as a dissolution of matter back into “first principles” or atoms.</note></seg>—</rdg>

I have chosen the plural, as the more apocalyptic in this generally apocalyptic poem. Eardley also gives “monarchies’” while Knight and Wall give “monarchy’s”. In the manuscript, line 36 ends in a comma, perhaps suggesting a third way of reading the couplet: if “foreshow” and “overthrow” are parallel verbs both subordinated to “why,” these lines could ask not just why the conjunctions of the planets could be predictive, but also why or how the conjunction of planets could overthrow monarchies—with the conjunctions not just predicting but causing the overthrow of monarchies.</note></seg> overthrow;</rdg>

          <rdg wit="#ae">And how fair <seg>Venus can be made<note type="gloss">Eardley states that “Hesperus” and “Vesperus” (now usually “Vesper”) were two names for the planet Venus, the former a corruption of the ancient Greek “Eosphorus” or morning star for when Venus appeared in the orient or the east, and the latter the name of the evening star when it appeared in the west (382). The speaker superficially wonders why one planet should have two names, or perhaps wonders, with the phrase “be made,” whether the change of name remakes the planet itself.</note></seg></rdg>

On Pulter’s heliocentrism as potentially Galilean, see Hutton, 5.</note></seg>,</rdg>

          <rdg wit="#ae"><seg>The eternal essence, even as we are known<note type="critical">As other editors have noted, these lines are a clear reference to 1 Corinthians 13:12: “For now we see through a glasse, darkely: but then face to face: now I know in part, but then shall I know euen as also I am knowen” (sig. R1v). There is some ambiguity in this line’s use of passive voice: we will know the eternal essence (God) even as we <hi rend="italic">are known</hi>—but by whom? It could mean that we will know God in the same way he knows us (completely), or it could mean that we will know God even as we are known by ourselves, even as we know ourselves—which, then, could be either completely, or incompletely. Does this poem climax with a vision of total, godlike, divine knowledge, or with a worry that the injunction to “know thyself” may, if not fully realized, cause an impartial knowledge of God’s eternal essence? How does this fantasy hold up to the claim of 1 Corinthians 13 that knowledge without love or charity is necessarily partial?</note></seg>.</rdg>
