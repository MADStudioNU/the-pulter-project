Anne Pulter, 1635–1666 (Eardley), was one of Hester Pulter’s daughters. While Pulter refers to her children at several points in the manuscript, this is the only poem in which she explicitly indicates her family’s awareness that she is a writer and their participation in her poetic production.

While that redacted dedication assigns the animating desire to Pulter’s daughter, Anne, who died in 1666, the poem itself suggests that it is the flowers who demand that the poet not only record their contention but adjudicate it.</note></seg></rdg>

						<note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

						<note type="editorialnote">My “amplified” editions seek to make the poems as accessible as possible by modernizing spelling and punctuation. Then I use the notes and the materials I gather for the “curations” section to place Pulter’s poems into conversations. As I build the curations for a given poem—provisional and quirky as they are—I keep returning to the poem, re-reading, rethinking, and adding layers to the notes. I hope to show that Pulter was intellectually and politically embedded rather than isolated, taking up issues, genres, and tropes that also interested her contemporaries and that sometimes accrue unpredictable salience in later periods. Rather than focusing only on possible sources or influences, I cast a wide net both within the seventeenth century and outside it, trying to catch cultural materials Pulter might have engaged, some she excludes or ignores, and even some she probably could never have imagined. Curations don’t precede the poems nor are they implied by the poems—as if the poem gathers them to itself (although it can sometimes feel that way) or hales them forth. Instead, as a curator I weave the poem into a web of relations, seeking to open out rather than close down interpretive possibilities. This extends to including extracts that are long enough that readers might find things therein that I do not anticipate. I also look for how Pulter’s poetry engages in multi-vectored exchanges with the other materials. What might the materials I’ve gathered help readers see in the poems—or notice is not there? But also, how do the poems bring fresh perspectives into the conversations into which I draw them? The more one reads the poems as participants in wider ranging conversations, the more fascinatingly twisty Pulter appears. Often, I don’t grasp how she upends or comes at conventions aslant until I have mucked about composting my “curations.”</note>

						<note type="headnote">Lying in her garden, Pulter finds herself the chosen umpire of a contest among a dozen flowers in this, her longest poem. Before she will choose a winner, she exhorts the disputants to describe their “virtues”—a word encompassing both moral and botanical meanings in a period when plants were key medicinal ingredients. As the garden members readily comply, Pulter is able to show off her extensive knowledge of botany (drawn from classical and contemporary natural histories and gardening manuals), especially its links to mythology. In addition to their role in health care, the plants concern themselves with their “color, beauty, fashion, smell”—alternately, as they speak in turn, vaunting themselves and mocking the other flowers’ grandiose claims about each other. As well as a spirited contribution to the poetic genre of the debate, Pulter’s poem quietly critiques a parliamentary system in which representatives devote themselves to self-promotion and mud-slinging more than any larger truth. No wonder the umpire’s discreet choice, in the end, is to cut short this mockery of a parliament—perhaps a particularly happy ending for a royalist like Pulter, whose country’s parliament cut short her king’s life and the monarchy itself, leaving her party to take solace in rural retreats. This garden, ironically, provides little peace or quiet, instead subjecting weary humans to the energetic quarreling that they might go there to escape.</note>

						<note type="headnote"><p>This is Hester Pulter’s longest poem, really a bouquet of twelve poems, each in the voice of a different flower, as the flowers “contend” or compete to see whom the speaker, their “umpire,” will choose as the winner. But what precisely is in contention among them and what is the standard by which one might win? They contend on the grounds of “virtue, color, beauty, fashion, smell.” Each flower speaks in the first person singular, representing her (or in one case, his) kind, but speaking as an individual, as if there were but one rose or one tulip, despite the fact that these flowers were usually planted in masses for maximum effect. Each representative emphasizes the “virtues” of its kind, simultaneously anthropomorphizing itself as having moral qualities and emphasizing its value and use for humans. These flowers are human adjacent, resembling humans and defining themselves through their service to humans. We can pick up details about color, appearance, shape, and scent from the flowers’ praise of themselves and disdain for one another, but otherwise the poem requires us to be able to imagine what each speaker might look like. In Curation <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Picturing Pulter’s Flowers</ref>, you will find illustrations of the flowers to help you picture them and to reinforce the ways that this is a very bookish garden, as informed by reading and imagination as it is by sensory experience. Does the poem draw attention to the household’s well-stocked flower garden, adding a level of fantasy by endowing the flowers with the power of speech, or does it present an imaginary garden in the place of a real one? In either case, placing the poem in context helps us appreciate its striking originality. While we can’t know exactly when Pulter wrote it, it is likely that it precedes and may have informed poems once considered influences on it, such as Andrew Marvell’s “The Garden” and Abraham Cowley’s <title rend="italic">Plantarum Libri Sex</title> (translated into English in 1668). (You will find these and other contentions and parliaments of plants, often contemporary with or later than Pulter’s poem, in Curations <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Other Garden Poems</ref> and <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Parliaments of Flowers</ref>.)</p><p>Written mid-century, the poem participates in what Keith Thomas calls “the Gardening Revolution,” during which many people invested time and money in their household gardens and in books that guided them in plant selection and care (<bibl>Keith Thomas, <title rend="italic">Man and the Natural World: Changing Attitudes in England, 1500-1800</title> [Oxford UP, 1983], 66, 224, 228</bibl>). In their gardens, men as well as women, lower status amateur gardeners as well as aristocrats with deep pockets and large staffs, not only transformed the natural world but remade and displayed their own social status. This revolution in domestic gardening depended on local circulation of seeds, cuttings, and knowledge as well as a brisk international trade in plants, a trade that ran in tandem with the slave trade. As Amy Tigner points out, “the plant market was intertwined with the slave trade, making its routes to Europe, on to the New World, and back again” (<bibl>Amy L. Tigner, <title rend="italic">Literature and the Renaissance Garden from Elizabeth I to Charles II: England’s Paradise</title> [Ashgate, 2012], 167, 194</bibl>).</p><p>Inviting the reader to spend considerable time in this garden, the poem enables us to consider what a garden is and means. It could be a place for contemplation, rest, and pleasure, an experimental site, or a site of work; the same person might experience the same garden differently at different times. In this poem, Pulter does not invite us to think about the labor a garden requires; the flowers want her praise but not her pruning. Gardens served also as emblems of order or of generative chaos, a terrain over which to impose mastery or an escape from oversight, as models of politics and as a respite from politics. These contentious flowers may defer to their judge, like good royalists, but they are also unruly and unpredictable. In some ways, “The Garden” levels distinctions. The first speaker, the Wallflower, boasts “I do not for a fit appear, / As doth the Tulip, but I all the year / Perfume the air” (90-92). This is a reminder that this gathering of flowers, including what Shakespeare’s Perdita identifies as flowers of the spring (violet, primroses, flower de luce or iris) as well as those of high summer (such as the July flower, which Perdita refuses to plant as “nature’s bastards”) could not occur except on the page. “The Garden” also gathers together flowers of different provenance. Flowers associated with royalty (the Tudor rose and the flower de luce) mix with humble cottage flowers (the woodbine and violet). Recent imports mix with more “English” flowers, although even botanists admitted that the two were hard to differentiate. John Parkinson distinguishes “Outlandish flowers, that for their pride, beauty, and earliness are to be planted in gardens of pleasure for delight”—which include for him many of the flowers in Pulter’s garden (woodbine, lilies, flower de luces, tulips, and auricula) from “those that are called usually English flowers,” yet he promptly concedes that while these are “called” English, “the most of them were never natural of this our land, but brought in from other countries at one time or other, by those that took pleasure in them where they first saw them” (<title rend="italic">Paradisi In Sole Paradisus Terrestris</title> [1629], 11). Many of the flowers who speak here were ones whose stature changed in the course of the seventeenth century, as they became more or less fashionable and costly; for example, the gillyflowers lost place to tulips and then auriculas as the “hot” flowers. Although they gather from various places and seasons, the high and the low, the fashionable and pedestrian, these flowers aren’t all just one big happy bouquet. This is, after all, a contention. The lily claims not to brag of its Persian origins (and does); the Rose boasts of its relation to Muhammad. The flowers in the garden often talk about blood, birth, and race, adding support to Jean Feerick’s argument that early modern texts “navigate human difference by reference to botanical discourse” (<bibl>Jean Feerick, “Botanical Shakespeares: The Racial Logic of Plant Life in <title rend="italic">Titus Andronicus</title>,” <hi rend="italic">South Central Review</hi> 26.1&amp;2 [2009]: 82-102</bibl>; see also <bibl>Rebecca Bushnell, <hi rend="italic">Green Desire: Imagining Early Modern English Gardens</hi> [Cornell UP, 2003], 132-160</bibl>).</p>
							<p>Gardens were often designed to be seen from the inside, through a window, yet Pulter plants her speaker in the garden, not looking out over it but lying in the midst of it. Claiming ownership over “my garden” and “my flowers,” the narrator, who is otherwise identified only as female and sad, has already shaped the debate by awarding the contenders a place in her garden. She does not have her own story to tell, serving only as a kind of mistress of ceremonies. The job the flowers then set her is to render a judgment, but the poem ends with her deferring that judgment to another day. We can view this as either indecisive, a refusal or failure to render the judgment promised and resolve the contention, or as a signal that this is a contention that is constantly restaged, impossible to resolve definitively.</p></note>

					<rdg wit="#ae" rend="left-gutter-1">First spoke <seg>the Double Woodbine<note type="gloss">The Double Woodbine is more commonly called the honeysuckle; it is described as “double” to distinguish it from other woodbines and to suggest its characteristic paired flowers with petals in two different colors. One often finds it as an ingredient in medicines for women. Because it is a twining, climbing, creeping vine, and has coupled blossoms, it is often described as amorous or wanton: “the flowers / Wantonly run to meet and kiss each other” (<bibl>James Shirley, <hi rend="italic">Changes: or, Love in a maze</hi> [London, 1632], Act 2</bibl>). <bibl>Richard Blome’s <hi rend="italic">The art of heraldry</hi> (London, 1685)</bibl>, describes the Woodbine as “a loving and amorous plant, embracing all that groweth near it, but without hurting of that which it loveth, and is contrary to the Ivy (which is a Type of Lust rather than Love) for it [meaning the Ivy] injureth that which it most embraceth” (p. 119). Woodbine is also often spelled woodbind, indicating its firm grasp on supports and invasive habit. While the Woodbine is one of the homelier of the flowers participating in this contention, gracing English cottages, she emphasizes her presence in antiquity and her intimacy with goddesses. She depends on more classical allusion than some of her more exotic rivals.</note></seg>, wondrous fair,</rdg>

					<rdg wit="#ae" rend="left-gutter-1"><seg>Shading their arbors and their stately towers<note type="critical">Bowers and arbors were man-made structures formed out of living plant material in outdoor spaces. Woodbine or honeysuckle, because both pliant and fragrant, was frequently used to construct or cover arches and structures that provided privacy. Parkinson calls the double honeysuckle “Ladies Bower,” and praises it as “the fittest of outlandish plants to set by arbors and banqueting houses, that are open, both before and above to help to cover them, and to give both sight, smell, and delight” (<bibl>Parkinson <title rend="italic">Paradisi</title> [1629], 10</bibl>). Parkinson thus positions the woodbine as both domestic and outlandish. In Shakespeare’s <title rend="italic">Midsummer Night’s Dream</title>, Oberon describes how Titania sometimes sleeps on a bank “quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine” (2.1.251) and Titania says she will embrace Bottom as “doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle / Gently entwist” (4.1.40-41). Weaving living plants into sturdy hedges and structures was called “pleaching” or “planching.” In Shakespeare’s <title rend="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</title>, Hero tells Margaret to “bid her [Beatrice] steal into the pleachèd bower / Where honeysuckles, ripened by the sun, / Forbid the sun to enter” (3.1.7-9). The pleachèd bower is also called “the woodbine coverture” (3.1.30); Benedick has hidden himself in this bower in 2.3 as well. (These and all quotations from Shakespeare are from <bibl><title rend="italic">The Norton Shakespeare</title>, third edition, ed. Stephen Greenblatt et al [New York: Norton, 2016]</bibl>). That the Woodbine here proceeds to tell the story of Diana and Acteon suggests how a “woodbine coverture” might foster an eroticized privacy but also one that is readily breached.</note></seg>?</rdg>

However, an amphora at the British Museum depicting events later in the life of Anchises includes the decoration of “double honeysuckle,” linking Anchises, his son Aeneas, and this flower (see Curation <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">The Flowers of Pulter’s Library: Myths</ref>).

					<rdg wit="#ae" rend="left-gutter-1">The Turkish <seg>turbans<note type="gloss">European variants of the word tulip derive from the Persian root it shares with the word turban. Early modern writers suggested this was because of a resemblance between blossom and turban. The botanist John Gerard calls this “strange and foreign flower” the “Tulipa or the Dalmation Cap” (<bibl><hi rend="italic">The Herball, or Generall Historie of Plantes</hi> [London, 1597], sig. H2v</bibl>),observing that “After it hath been some few days flowered, the points and brims of the flower turn backward, like a Dalmatian or Turk’s cap...whereof it took his name” (H3r). John Evelyn offers a different version of this claim when he writes that “the Turks who esteem no ornament comparable to that of Flowers” venerate the tulip above all others, “for which reason they adorn their turbans with them when they would appear in most splendor: &amp; hence it is, that they have given that name to the tulip, as the most capital flower” (<bibl><hi rend="italic">Elysium Britannicum</hi>, ed. John E. Ingram [U of Pennsylvania Press, 2000], p. 344</bibl>). The link between tulip and turban serves to exoticize the tulip, marking it as a stranger from Turkey (See <bibl>Benedict S. Robinson, “Green Seraglios: Tulips, Turbans, and the Global Market,” <hi rend="italic">JEMCS</hi> 9.1 [2009]: 93-122, esp. 107</bibl>). In Curation <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Parliaments of Flowers</ref>, see <hi rend="italic">Antheologia</hi>, in which the other flowers kick the tulip out of the garden and onto the dunghill because it is a foreign rival, unknown in English gardens 60 years earlier, that is supplanting them in popularity. Here, the Tulip seems to claim that Turks who wear turbans “enlarge” the tulip’s fame by sporting it as an ornament. The meaning of the Tulip’s claim about the turban becomes even more clear when the Wallflower next speaks, scolding the Tulip for boasting of its association with turbans.</note></seg> do enlarge our fames,</rdg>

In colloquial speech in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, it later extends its name to old clothes (presumably left hanging on clothes pegs on the wall) and to “A lady who keeps her seat at the side of a room during dancing, whether because she cannot find a partner or by her own choice” (OED). “The name heartsease,” which the Wallflower claims here, was also used for wild pansies or violas. Herrick’s poem “Why the Wall-flower came first, and why so called” makes the Wallflower the protagonist of a kind of <foreign rend="italic">de casibus</foreign> tragedy, suggesting she got her name by falling to her death off a wall in pursuit of her beloved (<bibl>Herrick, <title rend="italic">Hesperides</title> [London, 1648], 12</bibl>). It’s not clear that this garden has walls. Many early modern writers insisted that walls defined and protected the garden; the very word for paradise is connected to the Persian <foreign rend="italic">p<hi rend="overline">a</hi>l<hi rend="overline">i</hi>z</foreign>, describing a walled vegetable plot; the “verdurous wall” Milton describes enclosing paradise makes it paradise—even if it also fails to keep Satan out.

She also points out, however, that she is both beautiful and sweet and links perfume to immortality and good reputation, the “aromatic splendent fame” of the saint. The saint both has a reputation or fame that survives its death and, it was sometimes claimed, did not decay in death but rather had a sweet smelling corpse.

The poet Robert Herrick’s poem “How lilies came white” describes Cupid pinching his mother’s nipple, “Out of which the cream of light, / Like to a dew, / Fell down on you / And made ye white” (<hi rend="italic">Hesperides</hi> [London, 1648], 81). Abraham Cowley’s Lily announces “A goddess’ milk produced my birth” and Cowley provides this marginal gloss: “Jupiter in order to make Hercules immortal, clapped him to Juno’s breasts, while she was asleep. The lusty rogue sucked so hard, that too great a gush of milk coming forth, some spilt upon the Sky, which made the Galaxy or Milky Way; and out of some which fell to the Earth arose the Lily” (Cowley, <hi rend="italic">Third Part of the Works</hi> [1689], sig.

She insists that the answer to the question “what are colors?” is provided not by herself but by Reason. The Lily anticipates later arguments defending virtue as more than the absence of vice. Centuries later, G.K.Chesterton makes a similar argument: “White is a color. It is not a mere absence of color; it is a shining and affirmative thing, as fierce as red, as definite as black.... God paints in many colors; but He never paints so gorgeously, I had almost said so gaudily, as when He paints in white” (<bibl>“A Piece of Chalk,” in <hi rend="italic">Tremendous Trifles</hi> [Methuen: 1909], 5-6</bibl>).</note></seg>.</rdg>

According to Dugan, the Damask rose was “synonymous with the art of perfumery” because it was one of only two strains that could be “distilled into an essential oil” and, indeed, smells even better in its distilled form (<bibl>Holly Dugan, <hi rend="italic">The Ephemeral History of Perfume</hi> [Johns Hopkins UP, 2011], 44</bibl>). Although the Rose twits the Tulip as a parvenu, the damask rose had just arrived in England in 1522, having come from Syria and then into continental Europe via crusaders (45). But its “outlandish scent quickly became associated with Englishness”; “The scent of the rose performed an act of spatial hybridity, translating Damascus, Alexandria, and Persica into English space through the art of distillation and alchemical technology. ... The rose retains its outlandish status, but only as a marker of English mastery; its value is its aromatic properties, distilled to sweeten English bodies and selves” (Dugan, 53).</note></seg>.</rdg>

					<rdg wit="#ae" rend="left-gutter-1">The <seg>Heliotropium<note type="critical">We now use the word heliotrope to describe a flower from the borage family, with multiple small purple blossoms. In the early modern period, it was also called “turnsole,” as in turning toward the sun, and was a widely used source of a purple dye. Early modern writers seem to have used the word heliotrope to describe what we now call a Sunflower, what one writer calls “the lofty Cedar of flowers” (<bibl>Henry Hawkins, <title rend="italic">Partheneia Sacra</title> [1633], sig. D7v</bibl>).The heliotrope’s defining feature was the fact that it opened toward and followed the sun, seeming to offer a natural model of political and religious devotion to a single authority above. Nicholas Billingsley prays that he might be like the heliotrope: “Lord grant that as the heliotrope Apollo / My heart the Sun of righteousness may follow” (<bibl><title rend="italic">Kosmobrephia or the infancy of the world</title> [London, 1658], p. 149</bibl>). Robert Turner evokes the sun-facing heliotrope and marigold as model subjects: “In the heliotrope and marigold, subjects may learn their duty to their sovereign; which his sacred majesty King Charles I mentions in his Princely Meditations, walking in a garden in the Isle of Wight, in the following words, viz.: ‘The Marigold observes the Sun / More than my Subjects me have done, “&amp;”c.’” (<bibl>Robert Turner, <title rend="italic">Botanologia: The British Physician</title> (London, 1664), “To the Reader,” sig. A6r</bibl>). This is part of Turner’s case that people should attend to the lessons written in plants. In contrast, Walter Charleton points out that many flowers open toward the sun, responding simply to its warmth, and he dismisses those who think of this as both peculiar to the heliotrope and as a form of devotion as “champions of secret magnetism” who view a spontaneous response to the sun’s heat as the flower discovering its “amours to the sun, by not only disclosing its rejoicing head and bosom at the presence, and wrapping them up again in the mantle of its own disconsolate and languishing leaves, during the absence of its lover, but also by facing him all day long” (<bibl>Petrus Gassendus, <title rend="italic">Physiologia Epicuro-Gassendo-Charltoniana</title>, augmented by Walter Charleton [London, 1654], 349-50</bibl>).</note></seg> then began to <seg>vapor<note type="gloss">This is the poem’s preferred word for boasting.</note></seg>,</rdg>

There were many varieties. It might also be called a pink or carnation. Parkinson counts 48 types of gillyflowers and carnations in 1629; in the second half of the seventeenth century, Rea tallies 350 (Bushnell, <title rend="italic">Green Desire</title>, 151). According to Bushnell, they were “seen as an emblematic English flower (even though in fact the cultivated form, the carnation, came from the east and was imported into Western Europe only in the fifteenth century)” (Bushnell 150). Parkinson calls the July flower or gillyflower “the pride of our English gardens:” “But what shall I say to the Queen of delight and of flowers, carnations and gilloflowers, whose bravery, variety, and sweet smell joined together, tieth eueryone’s affection with great earnestness, both to like and to have them?” (Parkinson, <title rend="italic">Paradisi in Sole</title> [1629], 8, 12).

According to this story, Venus had a vision that Adonis would be killed while hunting; refusing to heed her warnings, he was, indeed, killed by a boar. Venus then mixed nectar with his blood to conjure an ephemeral flower in his honor. Adonis then, like Acteon, has a male human body that is transformed by a goddess. The poem invites us to imagine the bodies of several mythical men who were traumatically transformed into non-humans. In contrast, the flowers often invoke women’s bodies in sensual if fragmentary glimpses of the sensory organs flowers please, the body parts in which they are cherished, or the sleep or solace they provide. </note></seg> her joy.</rdg>

Richard Rainolde’s “A Narracion Poeticall upon a Rose” tells this story: “Whoso doth marvel at the beauty and goodly color of the red rose, he must consider the blood that came out of Venus the Goddess’ foot. The Goddess Venus, as foolish poets do feign, being the author of Love, loved Adonis the son of Cynara king of Cyprus. But Mars, called the God of battle, . . . loved Venus as fervently as Venus loved Adonis. . . . Venus only was inflamed with the love of Adonis, a mortal man. Their love was fervent, and extremely set on fire in both, but their kind and nature were contrary, whereupon Mars being in jealousy, sought means to destroy fair amiable and beautiful Adonis, thinking by his death, the love of Venus to be slaked. Adonis and Mars fell to fighting. Venus as a lover ran to help Adonis her lover, and by chance she fell into a rose bush and pricked with it her foot; the blood then ran out of her tender foot, did color the rose red: whereupon the rose being white before, is upon that cause changed into red” <bibl>(Richard Rainolde, <title rend="italic">A booke called the Foundacion of rhetorike</title> [London, 1563], sig.

Eardley, 104, n. 405</bibl>). St. Jerome, and following him, Milton, link Tammuz and Adonis. “It is Lucian who relates that the river Adonis, which runs down from Lebanon, was tinged with blood once a year from the wounds of Adonis [or Tammuz]; though Lucian himself adds the real explanation, viz., that the color of the river was derived from the red soil of the Lebanon” (<bibl>Francis Storr, ed., <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost Book I</title> [1874], 50</bibl>). As the Elemental Edition of this poem points out, Ezekiel 8 includes “women weeping for Tammuz” (8.14) in its inventory of “wicked abominations” of Jews who have lost faith because they fear that “the Lord seeth us not; the Lord forsaketh the earth” (8.12). This helps to explain the reference to “lapséd Jews.”</note></seg>;</rdg>

					<rdg wit="#ae" rend="left-gutter-1">We’ll (if you please) <seg>prorogue<note type="critical">Prorogue means to defer or postpone. With particular reference to Parliament, it evokes the monarch’s power to dissolve Parliament in order to limit its influence. King Charles I, for instance, established his Personal Rule by proroguing Parliament. Early English Books Online shows a peak of print titles including “parliament” in 1640-1649, the years of the English Civil Wars, in which Charles I was in conflict with and then at war with Parliament. During that time and thereafter, any reference to a parliament being prorogued would call on that history of conflict. Describing the flowers as a parliament suggests they have some power to come to a decision. However, they have ceded that power to the umpire and are more plaintiffs than parliamentarians here. As the Elemental Edition of the poem suggests, their conflict and indecision might reflect Pulter’s royalist suspicion of Parliament and its ability to achieve consensus.</note></seg> this Parliament.</rdg>
