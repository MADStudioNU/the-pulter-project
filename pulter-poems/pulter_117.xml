            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

              <note type="headnote">Be careful what you wish for, since you just might get it; but don’t stop hoping, wishing, and praying, because who knows what might happen? So goes the (understandably) tangled moral in this response to the chaos of Britain’s civil wars and the ensuing interregnum. Creaturely images of parasites and predators form a concatenation of opaque references to infestations of animals (locusts, ibis, serpents), identified in the manuscript’s margin with specific factions and figures (Presbyterians, Cromwell, Independents). For Pulter, this poem is unusually explicit in identifying the political players involved. Despite the clarity suggested by such one-to-one allegories, the speaker’s zoological emblems primarily serve to show the challenge of choosing who to trust in times of civil upheaval, when seeming saviors can disappear, or even prove enemies in the end. </note>

          <rdg wit="#ae">
            <note type="headnote">
                <p>Although the word “siege” does not appear until the final line of “The Caucasines,” it cements the figurative connection the emblem develops between being infested with waves of pests and being militarily invaded by various political factions. In an extended analogy, the speaker compares infestations that took place in ancient history to contemporary political power shifts. The Caucasines, the speaker informs us, struggled with a locust infestation until “selucides” (5), a type of bird, appeared out of nowhere and relieved them. The speaker then relates how the Egyptians were plagued by serpents until they, too, received help from a bird, this time the ibis. In this second example of infestation, however, the ibis spreads filth, and so the seeming rescuer becomes a bigger problem than the serpents. Things are even worse in the speaker’s own time: the “sad kingdom” the speaker inhabits similarly suffers an infestation, and not once, but twice, the seeming solution turns out to make things more terrible still. Marginal notes in the manuscript direct readers to equate Presbyterians with locusts that first “did o’er Run” England; Independents with “animals” (snakes) that devoured the locusts, but in turn “over all did crawl;” and the Protector, Oliver Cromwell, with the ibis that destroyed the snakes, but polluted everything “sacred” (14, 18, 20, 24). These infestations thus analogize anti-Royalist political factions (albeit conflicting factions) that contributed to the eventual seizure of power from the king through military force.<seg>1<note type="gloss">AE notes that the Presbyterians wanted to settle with the king, and the Independents forced them out of parliament (n. 493), but, arguably, they were part of a complex process that led to the power shift and to Charles I’s execution.</note></seg> Pulter’s diction shores up this connection between infestation and military aggression. Most obviously, the speaker refers to the locusts as an “army” (17). The word “annoy” also carried military resonance in Pulter’s time: when the serpents “did annoy” the Egyptians, they “inflict[ed] pain, harm, or injury,” “attack[ed], set upon, or oppress[ed] (an enemy),” or “launch[ed] repeated or persistent attacks against (an enemy territory, garrison, etc.).”<seg>2<note type="gloss"><title rend="italic">Oxford English Dictionary (OED)</title>, s.v. “annoy”, v., sense II.5 and sense II.6, September 2023.</note></seg> The locusts do the same to the Caucasines “annoyed” with them (1). The image of the “selucides,” moreover, “with their united strength and numerous power” (6), is suggestive of the arranged battle formations of military troops. And the serpents do not merely eat the locusts because that’s what serpents do; they “put these down” (19), the phrasing evoking the vanquishing of rivals or rebels. The words “destroyed” (2), “destroy” (11), and “afflicted” further attribute intentional violence to the infestations (13).</p>

                <p>The poem’s linking of infestation and invasion dehumanizes the Parliamentarians who seized power from Charles I. Pulter’s imagery of swarming locusts and snakes to represent anti-Royalists bears thematic similarity to her use of the hydra in other poems, such as poems <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="3">Aurora [1]</ref>, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="6">Universal Dissolution</ref>, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="7">On those Two Unparalleled Friends, Sir George Lisle and Sir Charles Lucas, Who Were Shot to Death at Colchester</ref>, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="42">Pardon Me, My Dearest Love</ref>, and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="54">A Solitary Complaint</ref>. As Frances E. Dolan remarks of poem 7, “the ‘horrid Hydra,’ ‘Cursed Rabble,’ ‘black army,’ and ‘sacriligious rout’ all link the Parliamentary cause, the New Model Army, and their supporters as a disorderly mob.”<seg>3<note type="gloss">Frances E. Dolan, ed., <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="7" target="ae">On Those Two Unparalleled friends, Sir George Lisle and Sir Charles Lucas, Who Were Shot to Death at Colchester</ref>, by Hester Pulter (Poem 7, Amplified Edition), in <title rend="italic">The Pulter Project: Poet in the Making</title>, edited by Leah Knight and Wendy Wall (2018).</note></seg> Similar to the monstrous hydra, swarming insects and reptiles in “The Caucasines” represent this same multitude as beastly and vicious, and made up of proliferating heads, such that for each head removed, two more can instantly fill the space. “Invocations of the swarm,” Joseph Campana finds, “tap into anxieties not merely about human masses but rather about hovering, leaderless collectivities whose appetites and impulses pose a threat to the idea that sovereignty was, whether by monarch or the by the people, necessary.”<seg>4<note type="gloss">Joseph Campana, “The Bee and the Sovereign (II): Segments, Swarms, and the Shakespearean Multitude,” in <title rend="italic">The Return of Theory in Early Modern English Studies, Volume II</title>, ed. Paul Cefalu, Gary Kuchar, and Bryan Reynolds (Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), 60.</note></seg> This assessment applies to Pulter’s Royalist depiction of Parliamentarians as swarming pests in that they threaten to overcome not mere individuals, but an entire mode of social organization and its founding concepts.</p>

                <p>But the depiction of the Parliamentarians as crawling vermin also tugs against its obvious implication of Royalist superiority. For seventeenth-century readers, locust and snake infestations would likely call to mind Biblical plagues, which typically signalled divine wrath. Through Moses, for example, God afflicted the Egyptians with several plagues for refusing to free the Israelites, including one of locusts (Exodus 10:12), and the Israelites themselves were subjected to a plague of serpents for speaking against God (Numbers 21:6). Pulter engages elsewhere with the idea that God will make use of vermin, the lowliest creatures, to exact justice, as Thomas Ward and Molly Hand each observe.<seg>5<note type="gloss">Thomas Ward, ed., <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="83" target="ae">Emblem 17</ref>, by Hester Pulter (Poem 83, Amplified Edition), in <title rend="italic">The Pulter Project: Poet in the Making</title>, edited by Leah Knight and Wendy Wall (2018); Molly Hand, ed. <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="111" target="ae">The Bishop and the Rats (Emblem 46)</ref>, by Hester Pulter (Poem 111, Amplified Edition), in <title rend="italic">The Pulter Project: Poet in the Making</title>, edited by Leah Knight and Wendy Wall (2018).</note></seg> <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="83" target="ae">Emblem 17</ref>, for instance, states in its first lines:</p>

                <p>Given this context, does “The Caucasines” obliquely worry that the afflicted Royalists are not faultless?</p>

                <p>This tug of doubt is present from the opening line’s reference to the “Caucasines,” inhabitants of Mount Casius. The likely source for the poem’s details about the “selucides” saving the Caucasines from the locusts, Pliny’s <title rend="italic">Natural History</title>, provides information about Mount Casius itself, namely that it was sacred to Jupiter, that at its foot stretched the Serbonian bog, and that its summit offered such an exceptional vantage point that someone standing there could, “with a little turning of his face and body … at one time see both day and night.”<seg>7<note type="gloss">Philemon Holland, Trans., <title rend="italic">The History of the World: Commonly Called the Naturall Historie of C. Plinius Secundus</title> (London: Adam Islip, 1634), book 5, ch. 12, p.100. STC (2nd ed.) 20030; book 5, ch. 13, p.100; book 5, ch. 22, pp. 102–3.</note></seg> Combined, these details paint Mount Casius as a place of starkly opposed possibilities. Since, in the poem, the Royalists are analogous to the Caucasines, Mount Casius could imply that they occupy moral high ground, that they’re closer to the divine than their attackers, and that their vantage point is superior. That vantage point, however, symbolically yields an equally sunny or dark view, depending upon which way you look. The hard-by Serbonian bog, moreover, hints that disaster and despair are never far away: this bog became synonymous for an inescapable situation, and it features as a reference point in the description of Hell’s landscape in Milton’s <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title>.<seg>8<note type="gloss">“The Serbonian Bog,” in <title rend="italic">Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</title>, 19th ed., ed. Susie Dent (Chambers Harrap, 2012, online version 2013), DOI 10.1093/acref/9780199990009.001.0001; John Milton, <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title>, ed. Scott Elledge, 2nd ed. (New York: Norton, 1993), book 2, ll.592-4.</note></seg> The “clouds” of locusts that afflict the Caucasines, and the snakes that “over all did crawl” in Egypt, are similarly engulfing (15, 20). The threat of being overtaken by a particulated mass is the inverse, in a way, of Pulter’s reflections in other poems on “physical dissolution” leading to “spiritual rebirth”.<seg>9<note type="gloss">Elizabeth Scott-Baumann, ed. <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="16" target="ae">The Revolution</ref>, by Hester Pulter (Poem 16, Amplified Edition), in <title rend="italic">The Pulter Project: Poet in the Making</title>, edited by Leah Knight and Wendy Wall (2018).</note></seg>
                </p>

                <p>The inescapable feeling of enduring a siege or infestation comes across structurally in Pulter’s use of repetition. Lines 10–11 repeat the rhyming words from lines 1–2, but with a shift in verb tense (“annoyed” / “destroyed” and “annoy” / “destroy”), signalling through form what the content makes clear – essentially the same thing happened all over again in another context. Sustained repetition of both words and rhymes, with “deplore,” “implore,” “before” (3–5), then “more,” “before” (12–13), and finally “before,” “deplore” (18–19), emphasizes the sense of enduring the same things, inescapably and without variety.</p>

                <p>The final five lines, however, offer hope of escape from the feeling of constant besiegement. Even though every seeming salvation previously backfired, the speaker doggedly resolves to appeal to God once more, and, fixing on the future as the unknown, envisions a saviour coming from the seas. These lines perhaps convey more than an emblematic notion of relief finally emerging out of rough times. As Stefan Graham Christian points out, speculation that the poem dates between 1658 and 1660 is tempting, “since it so manifestly looks for hope to materialize from the ‘Seas,’ and it was well known that Charles II, living on the continent since 1651, must return by sea to his country” (380). In the final lines, the speaker turns away from the Caucasines and Egyptians to another, more recent point of comparison for the weary Royalists – the Protestant citizens of La Rochelle. When besieged by the French king’s Catholic forces in 1572 and 1573, the Rochelais did receive relief from the seas when many fish unexpectedly washed ashore, saving them from starvation, as Leah Knight and Wendy Wall observe in the Elemental Edition of this poem. The poem closes on this hopeful note, the final word “wish” signifying at once the more-than-fulfilled wish of the sixteenth-century Rochelais and the still-active Royalist wish for the restoration of the monarchy.</p>

                <p>In more recent history, however, La Rochelle was again besieged by French royal and Catholic forces, and in 1628, having lost many citizens to starvation, capitulated.<seg>10<note type="gloss">John A. Lynn, “La Rochelle, siege of,” in <title rend="italic">The Oxford Companion to Military History</title> (Oxford UP, 2004); “La Rochelle,” in <title rend="italic">The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</title>, 2nd ed. (Oxford UP, 2006). Adam N. McKeown, <title rend="italic">Fortification and Its Discontents from Shakespeare to Milton</title> (New York and London: Routledge, 2019), 84-5, notes that when La Rochelle surrendered, only around 5000 of its inhabitants were alive, compared to 25000 “a year earlier.” By royal declaration, the “towers, sea walls, and all other fortifications” of La Rochelle were razed to the ground.</note></seg> English interest in this event is evident in contemporary print publications that range from a French engraver’s map of the fortifications and terrain of La Rochelle, to lamenting the loss of the French Protestant stronghold, and defending King Charles I against claims he did not commit adequate resources to La Rochelle’s defence.<seg>11<note type="gloss">See Melchior Tavernor, <title rend="italic">A true and most exact map of the siedge of Rochell, presented to the Kings Majestie the first day of May, 1628</title> (Paris: Melchior Tavernor, 1628; to be sold by Thomas Walkely, at the Eagle and Childe in Brittaines Bursse, 1628).

Wing (2nd ed.) T2083.</note></seg> King Charles’s favourite, George Villiers, first duke of Buckingham, led an expedition in support of La Rochelle in 1627, which ended in “humiliating defeat” and contributed to the Commons denouncing him as “the cause of all England’s evils.”<seg>12<note type="gloss">Roger Lockyer, “Buckingham, George Villiers, 1st duke of (1592–1628),” in <title rend="italic">The Oxford Companion to British History</title>, 2nd ed., ed.

This possibility is consistent with the frequently expressed sentiment, in Pulter’s oeuvre, that true release from earthly trials comes only through death and the afterlife.</p>

These birds come yearly to help them, but whither they fly back, or whence they come, no man can tell. So soon as the locusts are destroyed they forsake the mountain, and go home again.” <bibl><title rend="italic">History of Four-Footed Beasts</title>, (London, 1658), p. 988.</bibl></note></seg></rdg>
          <rdg wit="#ae">The <seg>Caucasines<note type="critical">Inhabitants of Mount Casius, a mountain on the Mediterranean coast, on the Syrian-Turkish border. Mount Casius is sacred to Jupiter (Philemon Holland, trans., <title rend="italic">The History of the World: Commonly Called the Naturall Historie of C. Plinius Secundus</title> [London: Adam Islip, 1634], book 5, ch. 12, p.100. STC [2nd ed.] 20030). In biblical history, it is sacred to the “storm god” (Michael D. Coogan, “Zaphon,” in <title rend="italic">The Oxford Guide to People and Places of the Bible</title>, ed. Bruce M. Metzer and Michael D. Coogan [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001, online version 2002]). Pliny relates that a person standing at Mount Casius’s peak could see day and night at the same time, simply by looking in opposite directions (Holland, <title rend="italic">Naturall Historie</title>, book 5, ch. 22, pp. 102-3). Pliny also notes that Herodotus places the Serbonian Lake at the foot of Mount Casius (Holland, <title rend="italic">Naturall Historie</title>, book 5, ch. 13, p.100). John Milton’s <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title> refers to this same lake to describe part of Hell’s landscape as, quicksand-like, capable of swallowing entire armies: “A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog / Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old, / Where armies whole have sunk” (John Milton, <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title>, ed. Scott Elledge, 2nd ed. [New York: Norton, 1993], book 2, ll.592-4). The Serbonian bog became figurative for a mess from which it is impossible to extricate oneself (“The Serbonian Bog,” in <title rend="italic">Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</title>, 19th ed., ed. Susie Dent [Chambers Harrap, 2012, online version 2013], DOI 10.1093/acref/9780199990009.001.0001).</note></seg> with <seg>Locusts<note type="critical">Pliny informs readers that locusts have no eyes (Holland, <title rend="italic">Naturall Historie</title>, book 11, ch. 37, p.334).

(OED s.v. “annoyed, adj.”, July 2023). As SC and AE point out, Pulter could have drawn from Pliny or Holland’s translation of Pliny the details of selucides ridding the mountain inhabitants of locusts, and Egyptians calling upon the ibis to help with snake infestations. The entries on the selucides and the ibis appear consecutively in these texts. For early modern readers, such infestations would also resonate with biblical stories, which associate plagues with divine wrath. Through Moses, for example, God afflicted the Egyptians with a plague of locusts, among others, for refusing to free the Israelites (Exodus 10:12), and the Israelites themselves were subjected to a plague of serpents for speaking against God (Numbers 21:6).</note></seg>,</rdg>

The spondee adds a fitting heaviness or ponderousness to “sad hearts,” which contrasts sharply with the two pyrrhic feet (first and third) in line 4. With only three stressed syllables, line 4 feels quicker and lighter than line 3, thus complementing the semantic difference between deploring suffering and seeking assistance.
