The final word of the title is blotted in the manuscript, but is clearly “home,” which AE says may be “in reference to Holdenby or Holmby House in Northamptonshire where Charles was kept under house arrest from February 7 until June 4, 1647” (p. 48, n. 12).</p>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

                <p>“The Invitation into the Country” is a glossing editor’s dream: filled with proper nouns, political figures, and references to mythological figures, local sites, rivers, birds, and plants, the poem positively and repeatedly cries out to be glossed. An early reader of the manuscript—whose hand is different from either the scribe’s or the correcting hand (most likely Pulter’s)—heard and responded to the poem’s cries for glossing, adding some notes in the margins showing that they had understood the references within (particularly, references to local rivers). The poem is not just an invitation for her daughters, inviting them to come into the country; it also invites you, its reader, to get lost in its specificities, in its proper nouns and lists of rivers and types of nymphs. But what is the political efficacy of getting so lost in details?</p>
                <p>As an editor, I attempted to respect this particularity of the poem—its desire for and invocation of glosses—and to provide information about the rivers, plants, and mythological figures Pulter names within. After all, a modern reader may not immediately know that a Napaea is a nymph of mountains, or that Grey’s Spring was a spring thought to have petrifying properties. On the other hand, the poem is curious in that its many specific references do not seem to enhance its overall argument: having more than that minimal information about a Napaea, or about Grey’s Spring, doesn’t significantly change or deepen your understanding of the lines that mention them: she hits on these specific references in passing, then moves on to other things. Providing <hi rend="italic">more</hi> information on these proper nouns seems like a distraction, in a poem that is so much about the relationship between politics and forms of distraction (literary and otherwise). (For more on the politics of distraction, see the Headnote to this poem.)</p>
                <p>I have therefore implemented a two-tiered system of glossing. First, for each of the poem’s many references to proper nouns, mythological figures, English plants, etc., I have provided a short reference, headed as a “GLOSS NOTE.” These references I have kept minimal and short—which is all the attention I think readers should give them, and all that I think understanding the poem requires. The changing density of boxes (which appear around a word or phrase to indicate a note) will also help readers see at a quick glance where the poem’s sometimes desperate or compulsive iteration of objects, rivers, etc. becomes most intense, and where it abates (for example, there is an explosion of references after the poem’s great break or volta at line 73). Most of these gloss notes are supplied from the <title rend="italic">OED</title>; other sources are documented in critical notes. Second, longer critical notes and textual notes, each labelled accordingly, explain editorial choices, paraphrase difficult words and sentences, provide references to echoes in Pulter’s works, and call attention to interesting textual and interpretive ambiguities.</p>
                <p>This poem had two kinds of intervention even in its life as a manuscript poem. As mentioned above, there are at least three contributors to this poem: the scribe who initially copied it; a correcting hand, probably Pulter’s; and a later marginal annotator who provided some initial glosses. My textual notes record interesting interventions in the early manuscript; in addition, where the early marginal annotator has provided a gloss, I provide their gloss, and label it with “ORIGINAL GLOSS NOTE”.</p>
                <p>Finally, perhaps because of the complicated history of editorial intervention in the manuscript, the text of this poem is somewhat unstable: different editors have seen different things in the manuscript, and have made different (sometimes silent) emendations. I have therefore included with the poem a textual apparatus, including information about the decisions that different transcriptions and editions have made around certain textual cruxes in the poem. These textual notes appear among my other notes. I refer to the manuscript in notes as <hi rend="bold">MS</hi>. Previous editions cited in textual and other notes are abbreviated as follows:</p>

I have also modernized punctuation, and expanded poetic abbreviations where such expansions would not affect the meter for a modern reader. For example, I expanded “Dispis’d” into “Despised,” as a modern reader would naturally read that word with two syllables. In instances where a final “ed” in the manuscript seems to suggest an additional syllable, I have modernized as “èd” (for example, the manuscript’s “changed,” pronounced with two syllables for metrical purposes, became modernized as “changèd”).</p>

              <note type="headnote">In this poem, Pulter invites two of her London-based daughters, Margaret and Penelope, to leave the city and join her at Broadfield, her country estate. The poem first presents an elegiac and pastoral complaint about the social, sexual, and natural decline of the city due to the fact that King Charles has been removed from London and imprisoned in Holmby House by parliamentary forces. Using iambic tetrameter couplets, the poem champions the virtues of the countryside and rural life using conventional pastoral motifs, but then moves away from the typical comparison of court and city to concede that all areas have been corrupted by political unrest. Blending mythological and horticultural references with allusions to the topography of her estate and the region, the poem offers a political pastoral that ends with the hope of the restoration of the monarchy. Events discussed in the poem suggest that Pulter wrote this poem earlier than most in the Pulter’s collection.</note>

                <p>What is a political poem? There is no question that this poem is political insofar as it has political content: the title’s explicit date (in the midst of the English Civil War) and mention of the king at “Unhappy Home” clearly signals the political setting and occasion for the poem. However, the poem begins not as an address to the king, but as an address to her daughters. The title’s mysterious string of initials—D. D. M. P. P. P.—gives itself away, deciphers itself, from the very first line. “Dear daughters, come,” it says, addressing her D[ear] D[aughters] M[argaret] P[ulter and] P[enelope] P[ulter]; in the process, it shows the “mixture of revelation and concealment” common in Royalist writers,<seg>1<note type="gloss">Lois Potter, <title rend="italic">Secret Rites and Secret Writing: Royalist literature 1641–1660</title> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), p. 43.</note></seg> using coded language not necessarily to hide a meaning, but to call attention to the thing being hidden. The contradictory impulses evident in the title—both boldly taking a political position (referring to the king as “his Sacred Majesty”) and using initials as an easily decoded encoding—also occur throughout the poem.</p>
                <p>For example, it is difficult to say what genre this poem is. If the end of the title signals its desire to be a political poem, the start of the title, “An Invitation into the Country,” signals something very different. Students of Renaissance poetry may hear in the title an echo of Christopher Marlowe’s famous “Come live with me and be my love,” which invites a beloved into the country to enjoy simple, pastoral pleasures. Students of Pulter may hear in the poem itself echoes of her Emblem 20, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="85">This Poor Turtle Dove</ref>, which warns women about the evil temptations of London. Or readers may think of the seventeenth-century genre of the country house poem, which extols the virtues of country estates over crowded London streets. These poems of invitation and country-house poems themselves draw on the genre of the pastoral, which idealizes the country and the work of shepherds, and Pulter signals the pastoral nature of the poem not only by setting it in the countryside, but also by giving the King and Queen pastoral code names (Amintas and Chloris, respectively).</p>
                <p>However, even as the beginning of the poem signals its generic affiliations, it also breaks them. “Invitation into the Country” begins, as promised, as a song of <hi rend="italic">invitation</hi>, including a repeated refrain (with variations): “Then come, sweet virgins, come away; / What is it that invites your stay?” The song of invitation progresses logically: first she details the unhappinesses of city life, and then the virtues of country life. While the city has “shepherds that no flocks do keep” (l. 19), the country has “careful shepherds” whose gentle guidance protects their flocks (l. 49ff). Then things take a turn. Pulter’s poem is approximately 190 lines long, with the first 72 lines falling into discrete stanzas ending in the refrain; between lines 72 and 73, the poem suddenly swerves into pastoral elegy, listing rivers, birds, flowers, plants, and mythological creatures all mourning the loss (but not death) of the king. In this revised pastoral elegiac landscape, “since Amintas [King Charles] went away, / Shepherds and sheep go <hi rend="bold">all</hi> astray” (ll. 75–76; emphasis added), and the lines right after the turn specifically catalogue the destruction of typical pastoral pleasures like maypoles and “lively lasses dancing round” (l. 86). Suddenly the poem is not a poem of invitation extolling country virtues, but is closer to John Milton’s pastoral elegy “Lycidas,” or closer still to Lucy Hutchinson’s political pastoral elegy “Musings in my Evening Walks at Owthorpe,” where trees and flowers “languish,” “drooping,” and “murmuring springs rise and complain / Then shrink into the earth again” (ll. 14, 13, 17–18).<seg>2<note type="gloss">Lucy Hutchinson, “Musings in my Evening Walks at Owthorpe,” in <title rend="italic">Women Poets of the English Civil War</title>, ed. Sarah C.E. Ross and Elizabeth Scott-Baumann (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2018), pp. 290–92.</note></seg></p>
              <p>This swerve also changes the poem formally: after line 72 there are no more stanza breaks, and the song’s refrain disappears until the very last lines, where it returns to end the poem:</p>

              <p>The radical turn in the middle of the poem raises many questions. Generically and formally the poem is fascinating, establishing a clear pattern only to egregiously, flauntingly break it. The sudden turn at line 73 almost seems like the beginning of a new poem, and a new genre, though the repetition of the refrain at the end insists on the unity of the two disparate halves. How are we to interpret the sudden swerve from a song of invitation into pastoral elegy, an instance of the pathetic fallacy run deliberately (and politically) wild? How do the two parts fit together, and why has Pulter combined two different genres in such a way as to let the seams so obviously show? And what are the politics of this formal and poetic disjunction?
                </p>
                <p>
                   The final lines of the poem, quoted above, highlight the broader problem of this poem’s strange relationship to politics. It is not clear, in these lines, whose return it is that she desires: does the “them both” of line 185 refer to the king and queen of England (as most editors have assumed), or is she merely asking for her two daughters to return to her country estate at Broadfield to comfort her? The causal “then” of the refrain perhaps suggests the latter: “I will not be able to feel any comfort until I see <hi rend="italic">them</hi> restored—so come, daughters, and comfort me.” If the “them both” is in fact King Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria then these final lines are even more bizarre: “Nothing will comfort me until the king and queen are restored—so, come, daughters, and comfort me, though I have literally just said that no comfort but the restoration of the monarchy will be comforting.” What is the poem asking for? What does it want? What comfort does it imagine?</p>
                <p>The final lines, then, seem to worry at the larger political and poetical problem of the relationship between agency and despair. Is this a private poem of a mother missing her daughters, hoping they can cure her (and the countryside’s) despair? Or is it, even obliquely, requesting political, public solutions for her private despair? “Nothing can comfort me,” the end may be saying, “except the restoration of the monarchy. With that in mind: I am asking you to comfort me.” Does the request for emotional comfort cancel the implicit request for political action, or prompt it?</p>
                <p>This problem, of whether emotion is an invocation of political agency or an invitation to political retreat, runs through the poem as a whole. Consider, for example, the image of the “weeping” fanes or temples with which the poem begins; seeing moisture dripping down walls is both a projection of her own sadness onto damp marble, but also an exhortation to feeling in others: “Hard hearts, insensible of woe, / Whom marble walls in grief outgo!” (ll. 7–8). Even marble walls, she tells her readers, are showing their grief; how much harder is the matter of your heart, to not do the same? This same problem is a preoccupation of much Royalist poetry, which responded to defeats with images of closed circles: Richard Lovelace’s snail “within [its] own self curled,” Alexander Brome’s circle of imprisoned carousers, Andrew Marvell’s desire to retreat into “The Garden” and “transcend” worldly troubles, converting potentially political impulses instead to “a green thought in a green shade.” The second part of Pulter’s poem, especially, responds to this strand of Royalist writing, and this poem’s curation <ref target="#ctxs" type="pp-curations-ref">How to Do Things with Political Poetry</ref> provides examples both of some (beautiful) examples of Royalist poetic escapism, as well as examples of radical poems that mock the Royalists for retreating into verse, and are modelled instead on chants and calls to action.</p>
                <p>Pulter’s “Invitation into the Country” situates itself among these political questions of pastoral poetry and agency, but it is striking that unlike some of her more explicitly topical political poems this poem offers not only commentary on a specific historical moment, but also a meta-reflection on the relationship between poetry and political agency; its formal problems—the questions of poetic form and genre—also become political problems.</p>

            <p>In early modern handwriting, “u” and “n” are written identically, so for the word I have given as “lonely” the MS could read either “lonely” or “louely” (lovely). I have interpreted the third graph (or letter) as an “n” as it makes more sense to me, in this dismal landscape, that the violet should creep into a <hi rend="italic">lonely</hi> shade for its weeping. Further, that the violet is unpitied (l. 164) is perhaps because, in the lonely shade, there is no one else around to pity it. The MS’s ambiguity, however, is an interesting one, especially given that there is an identically written word (lonely / louely) only four lines earlier that almost certainly means “lovely.”</p>

            <p>The manuscript reads “caves,” but the letters “u” and “v” were interchangeable in the period, so I have read it as “caues” to rhyme with “laws” and modernized as “cause.” The image of flowers “sleeping in their causes”—returning to their first principles, or existing as latent potentiality—is a common one in Pulter’s work; see also <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="6">Universal Dissolution</ref>, l. 14, and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="39">The Perfection of Patience and Knowledge</ref>, l. 5.</p>
