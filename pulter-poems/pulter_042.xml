            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>
          <rdg wit="#ae">
              <note type="editorialnote">To make the poem accessible for all readers, I have modernized the text of Pulter’s manuscript by updating spelling, expanding contractions, and standardizing capitalization. The only exceptions are cases where the form or the sense of the poem would be lost by modernizing, particularly the elision of syllables to preserve meter. I have also supplied punctuation because, as was typical for seventeenth-century poetry manuscripts, Pulter’s poems contained almost no punctuation. There are both benefits and liabilities to this approach. While the introduction of punctuation improves the sense of grammatical structures for modern readers, it loses the productive ambiguities of the manuscript, where clauses might connect to each other in multiple ways. So I would invite readers to proceed by comparing the edition to the images of the manuscript and the transcription supplied by <hi rend="italic">The Pulter Project</hi>. Do you agree with the punctuation that I’ve introduced? How might the meaning of the poem change without it?</note>

            <note resp="#lknight" type="headnote">Pulter’s only poem written to her husband consists of an apology for courting another “love.” In this poem, she unusually acknowledges her romantic and marital commitments by describing herself as her husband’s “poor turtledove,” a creature famed for virtuous and lifelong fidelity. Conceding that her husband has a right to her care and attention while she is on earth, she asks his pardon for her constant preoccupation with the allures of Heaven, her flights of fancy that allow her to activate the “sparkle” of heavenly essence in her soul and seemingly abandon “this dirty, dunghill earth.” The world materializes as a place of excrement, violent dismemberment, and sin, with the glories of heaven drawing out a “love” that Pulter represents as rivalling (rather than complementing) her romantic attachments on earth.</note>
          </rdg>
          <rdg wit="#ae">
              <note type="headnote"><p>“Pardon Me, My Dearest Love” is about the limits of love and fidelity. This is Pulter’s only poem addressed to a lover, who seems likely to be her husband; no other earthly lover is named or introduced. In fact, the problem that animates the poem is the poet’s tenuous investment in her relationship. Even though the speaker owes the addressee her body, he cannot constrain the movement of her soul. She acknowledges that “What’s subsolary is yours”—literally that he owns what is below the sun—for as long as “life endures,” but then immediately concedes that her mind seeks a joy that cannot be found among the muck and dust of “this dirty dunghill earth.” What follows is a story about both the past and the future of her lively soul, which is personified to an unusual degree. Born in a “sparkle” of the light of eternal salvation, her “aspiring mind” yearns—or more basically, breathes towards, from the Latin root <foreign rend="italic">spirare</foreign>–the highest good of heaven.</p>
                  <p>This poem explores marital love by exposing the partial and insufficient satisfaction of erotic commitment. The speaker’s earthly condition is temporary. Death is inevitable, and her body, the “due debt” that she owes her husband, will soon be dissolved back into the elements out of which it is made. When that division takes place, body and soul will be cleaved just as traitors are drawn and quartered in punishment for their rebellion. But in an unexpected turn, this image of violent dismemberment becomes a moment of liberation that will set her “enfranchis’d spirit” free, dissolving the bonds of earthly commitment.</p>
                  <p>Pulter develops this ambiguous account of marriage through a conceit common to seventeenth-century poetics: the uneasy and mutable tethering together of body and soul. In “Church-Monuments,” George Herbert describes life on earth as a fleshly tomb, a “school” for the body in which it “may learn / To spell his elements, and find his birth / Written in dusty heraldry” (ll. 6-8).<seg>1<note type="gloss"><bibl>George Herbert, <title rend="italic">The Complete Poems</title>, ed. John Tobin (London: Penguin, 1991), pp. 58-59</bibl>.</note></seg> For Herbert, the body becomes a measure of time, both in the dusty contents it holds and in its form, which will itself dissolve back into dust. Death will “sever that good fellowship of dust” because “flesh is but the glass, which holds the dust / That measures all our time; which also shall / be crumbled into dust” (ll. 13, 20-22). Anticipating this same separation of body and soul, the speaker of Pulter’s “Pardon Me, My Dearest Love” finds solace in the eternal joy promised when her spirit will be free from earthly constraint, “melt[ing] and molder[ing] into dust.”</p>
                  <p>In a concluding gesture, the poem makes a surprising return to the opening concession, but the plea for a pardon now rings more hollow. The final three lines are a rhyming triplet that add “turtledove,” the bird that famously mates for life, to the pairing of “love” and “above,” a rhyme that appears twice previously in the poem. While triplets are unusual in seventeenth-century poetry, Pulter uses them often. <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="16">The Revolution</ref> is written entirely in triplet stanzas, and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="15">Let None Sigh More for Lucas or for Lisle [On the Same (2)]</ref> is also in couplets with a concluding triplet. In “Pardon Me, My Dearest Love,” the effect of the final triplet is to propose that the poem’s exploration of “endless joy and love” cannot be contained by the established couplet rhymes. It offers a concluding “anticouple” that works against the heteroerotic terms of the preceding couplets. The final two lines show the speaker’s mind once again beginning to whirl “above,” away from the “confinement” that currently holds her soul in captivity. With the near repetition of the beginning, we are left to anticipate the poem starting over again, as if the speaker’s lively mind will continually resist the confinement of her dusty body.</p></note>

            <rdg wit="#ae">Thus, like <seg>traitors quartered out<note type="gloss">A reference to the capital punishment for high treason in which the convicted traitor was drawn through public view by a horse, hung from the gallows until nearly dead, and then cut down to be disemboweled, burnt alive, decapitated. The mutilated body was finally “quartered out,” that is, cut into four pieces which would be displayed with the head. The punishment is a gruesome and literal “dividing” of the earthly body and, interestingly for Pulter, only applied to male traitors. Women were more simply drawn and burnt.</note></seg></rdg>
