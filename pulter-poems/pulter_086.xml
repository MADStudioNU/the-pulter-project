For example, what according to modern usage is incorrect subject/verb agreement might have been deemed acceptable to a seventeenth-century scribe or compositor. All such instances are treated instead using the ORIG and REG tags. (See below.)</p>
          <p>Corrections and annotations made within the scope of the original document either by its original authors, owners, and/or transcribers are noted using ADD tags.

            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>
          <rdg wit="#ae">
              <note type="editorialnote"> In my editions, I prioritize accessibility and multiple interpretive possibilities. To prepare these poems for a wide range of readers, I have modernized erratic early modern spelling, punctuation, and capitalization to conform to standard American usage. I gloss archaic definitions and confusing syntax, and I expand contractions, unless needed to maintain the integrity of the poem’s form. When citing the Bible, I use the King James Version. When a note relies on Alice Eardley’s edition of <title rend="italic">Pulter’s Poems, Emblems, and The Unfortunate Florinda</title> (Toronto: Iter, 2014), I cite her text generally as “Eardley.” My notes investigate how Pulter’s poems engage with the literature and culture of mid-seventeenth-century England. At the same time, I emphasize how her poems are unique, how they respond to one another and seem to reveal their author’s individual circumstances and philosophies. It is worth noting that although Pulter’s poems survive in only one known source, they are not necessarily stable texts. The source manuscript features variants and revisions that invite multiple interpretations. I encourage readers to refer to the manuscript transcriptions and images on this site; my notes alert readers when the manuscript’s original spelling or physical features are especially worth considering.</note>

              <note type="headnote">Pulter is at her most people-pleasing in this emblem on teamwork; nonetheless, she starts as usual with an example from the animal world. She apparently later realized that she erred in naming the creature in question, and the behavior attributed here to raccoons better resembles that of beavers, at least as described by William Wood in a book aimed equally at “the mind-travelling reader” and “the future voyager” to America (as he puts it on his title page). Pulter’s own mind also travels, here—from Wood’s beavers to outstanding examples of human cooperation, and from London Bridge to ancient temples in the Middle East—before turning to the benefits of creaturely teamwork. Humans should learn the lesson embodied best by these furry “nimble creatures,” Pulter observes, to achieve great feats—including, ironically, the subjugation of other species. Her final example returns to the uniquely human domain, however, when she reflects on how no single person could possibly have written all of the books in the world—or, perhaps, even the number she consulted in composing this poem. This is Pulter’s paean to collaboration as an ideal (never an unproblematic category) that crosses centuries and even species.</note>
          </rdg>
          <rdg wit="#ae">
              <note type="headnote">This poem argues that one person alone cannot build immense structures, tame large animals, or write all the books in the world. Addressing readers who love spectacle, Pulter invites them to examine an exotic animal that works naturally in groups. This animal is called a “raccoon” to fit the end rhyme of the opening triplet, but it acts more like a beaver, gnawing wood and pulling its companions by the tail. By crossing out the word “raccoons,” an early reader or editor of Pulter’s manuscript lends credence to the possibility that this word was an error. We might also note that the poem does not critique the idea of humans exploiting and forcing into submission a variety of other animals for the sake of entertainment.</note>
