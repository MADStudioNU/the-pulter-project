This might occur when the moon passes through the earth’s shadow or when the moon comes between the observer and the sun; in a figurative sense, an eclipse may refer to the (sometimes temporary) loss of brilliance or distinction of any kind.</note></seg></rdg>

            <rdg wit="#ft"><note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note></rdg>
            <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>
            <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="editorialnote">My editorial goals are accessibility and attention to the multiplicity of interpretation. By modernizing spelling and punctuation according to American standards and by providing a gloss for archaic words, I make the poem legible for a wide array of readers and students. Some notes are designed to offer contextual information indicating Pulter’s intellectual breadth—for instance, the way that her chosen lexicon blends cosmological, scientific, and religious domains. Other notes seek to illuminate Pulter’s poetic craft by offering commentary on the syntactical and formal features in the text, some of which present knotty puzzles that entangle the reading experience.</note></rdg>

              <note resp="#lknight" type="headnote">The first poem in Pulter’s manuscript boldly traverses vast distances—cosmological, mythological, and theological—as the speaker objects to various obstacles to her clear vision of the heavens: that is, both the skies above and, ultimately, the God above them. Uniquely among her poems, “The Eclipse” is set forth in numbered sections, with numerals 1 through 4 carving out two-sestain sections, each addressing a distinct figure: clouds, the earth, the moon. These figures are characterized as material obstacles which are in the way at the moment but ultimately mortal; the speaker seems comforted by her contemplation, or the threat, of their eventual “dissolution.” Mortality itself, in the form of a personified Death, is then directly addressed in the fourth section, while in what could be considered the unnumbered fifth section, the speaker turns to sin as the most obdurate obstacle between herself and heaven. While the ranks of obstacles thus assembled each in turn appear formidable, only the last sees the speaker daunted, before a final stanza expresses her faith in Christ’s triumph over sin on her behalf. The poem is in iambic pentameter stanzas, rhyming ABABCC.</note>
          </rdg>
          <rdg wit="#ae">
            <note type="headnote">This first poem in <title rend="italic">Poems Breathed Forth by the Noble Hadassas</title> is the only one written in sixains (ABABCC). The speaker’s use of apostrophe in the first three sections serves to vivify elements of the natural world as interlocutors, and thus introduces a theme that will thread throughout the poems: the animation of the physical world. “The Eclipse”’s interest in blending the discourses of cosmology and salvation is explored in numerous poems. Here the speaker moves from accusations that external objects in the skies block her access to the sun (figuratively God), to complaints about abstract personifications (Death), and finally to recognition that her internal transgressions impede her faith. The final stanza nestles the speaker “in Christ” as the solution to her initial, spatially expressed alienation. When John Donne similarly takes up faith and astronomy in “Good Friday: Riding Westward,” by contrast, he relies on the older Ptolemaic cosmology and the doctrine of correspondences. One popular literary source for information about Copernicanism was Henry More’s 1647 Philosophical Poems, especially “Psychathanasia, or The Second Part of the Song of the Soul.”</note></rdg>

            <rdg wit="#ae" rend="left-gutter-1">Malicious clouds, before you <seg>rarefy<note type="gloss">dissipate, purify</note><note type="critical">Pulter often deploys the alchemical term “rarefy” to describe both material and spiritual transformations. In alchemy, the process of rarefaction involves the purification of a substance by separating the essence from its “gross” elements. This involved condensation (mentioned in the second stanza) or vaporization (and alchemy uses the language of rebirth and renewal shared by Christianity). On Pulter’s use of “rarefy,” see, for instance, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="16">The Revolution</ref>; <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="21">The Circle [2]</ref>; and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="41">The Invocation of the Elements</ref>. In “The Eclipse,” the clouds are imagined to cycle from transparency, to vapors, and, perhaps, to rain, inaugurating another cycle. The “variable condition” (l. 5) that the speaker sees as linking her to the physical world makes both subject to decay, but also mobile enough to undergo the “passage through revolution” toward salvation (l. 45). The poem thus trades on language embedded in both alchemy and Christianity.</note></seg>.</rdg>

                  <p>“Dissolve” and “dissolution” are terms Pulter often uses to signal the interconnection of disintegrative and reconstructive cycles of formative elements (see, for example, the poems <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="6">Universal Dissolution</ref> and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="48">Immense Fount of Truth</ref>).
