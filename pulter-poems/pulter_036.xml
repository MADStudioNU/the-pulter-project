                        The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers,
                        which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and
                        punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might
                        otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not
                        modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote
                        aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by
                        Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to
                        allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various
                        possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure
                        material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford
                        Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s
                        edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The
                        result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.

                    <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="editorialnote">With an undergraduate and graduate student audience in mind, this poem has been modernised in spelling and punctuation. Where modernisation would affect form, priority has been given to the integrity of the poem’s formal features (so, for instance, verb endings -est and -eth have been retained unmodernised; where the meter requires it, the verb ending -ed is accented, e.g., “Then shall thy blessèd influence”). Nouns have been capitalized only when there is clear personification. The notes provide information essential to understanding the poem, while the Headnote aims to stimulate readers’ own interpretations through suggesting literary or historical contexts, possible influences, comparable poems (by Pulter and by her predecessors and peers) and relevant critical arguments.</note></rdg>

                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">In a short poem composed of five tetrameter couplets and constituting a single long sentence, Pulter fuses two of her favorite topics: circles and sunrise. In this last of four poems entitled “The Circle,” she describes God’s circular movement downward from the heavens that concludes with Astraea, the last deity living on earth, fleeing back to skies to become the constellation Virgo. In the middle of this cycle Pulter presents an interesting conversion and return from biblical to classical contexts: the male “eternal Spirit” who creates the world by separating light out of chaos morphs into the female classical figure of Aurora (goddess of the dawn), who gives birth to Astraea (goddess of justice). Astraea lived on earth during the utopian Golden Age, which Pulter characterizes as a time when Christian truths were revealed to humans (who had fallen through sin, unlike God’s descent through grace). Astraea completes the motion of the circle by returning to be enveloped in the heavens (and Heaven). The proliferating clauses of the sentence underscore the generative genealogy of divine powers.</note></rdg>

                  <p>In the first lines of the Bible, God creates light:</p>

                    <quote>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</quote>

                  </cit>
                  <p>Genesis describes light being created but in Pulter’s poem, it is instead “extracted”, a chemical verb, often used for distillation, and it is characteristic for Pulter to bring technical and alchemical language to devotional poetry (see also, for instance, ‘The Hope’ and ‘The Revolution’). The gender dynamic in the personifications of this poem are interesting, as divine power moves from the male God of the opening to the “virgin womb” of Astrea. In the opening of <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title>, also meditating on these lines from Genesis, Milton imagines the Holy Spirit both “brooding” (like a female bird) and impregnating (as a male):</p>

                    <p>As well as chemical process, Pulter combines Biblical and Roman narratives about light. Her word “lapsèd” hinges between these two spheres, referring to mankind’s wickedness after the Golden Age of Roman myth and also etymologically suggesting the Fall from Eden in Genesis. In this, her fourth poem called ‘The Circle’, Pulter enacts the title; her poem’s opening and closing lines end with the same words, “life and love”.</p></note></rdg>
