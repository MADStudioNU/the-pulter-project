            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

            <note type="editorialnote">Our priority in editing these poems has been to modernise, and to achieve interpretative and visual clarity, in order to make the poems as accessible as possible to as wide a modern audience as is possible. Spelling is modernised, as is punctuation. Modernising the latter, in particular, often involves a significant act of editorial interpretation, but in our view this is one of the most productive areas of editorial intervention, particularly for a manuscript text such as Pulter’s where the punctuation is erratic compared to modern usage (and, indeed, compared to early modern printed texts).<seg>[1]<note type="gloss">See Alice Eardley, “‘I haue not time to point yr booke … which I desire you yourselfe to doe’: Editing the Form of Early Modern Manuscript Verse”, in <hi rend="italic">The Work of Form: Poetics and Materiality in Early Modern Culture</hi>, ed. Ben Burton and Elizabeth Scott-Baumann (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), pp. 162–178.</note></seg> All biblical references are to the King James Version (1612).</note>

            <note type="headnote">Emblem 36 addresses “my dear pledges of our constant loves”: apparently, the poet’s own children, of which Pulter had fifteen (though not all lived to hear this poem). They are summoned to share the poet’s vision of some pearl-eating birds—an unusual sight, and so a compelling invitation. But the moral of the story is more ordinary: like the birds with their permanently internalized pearls, the speaker enjoins her offspring to “treasure sacred truths within your heart.” Pulter then raises the stakes by vividly imagining the “tyrant lapidaries” who might try to mine those jewel-like truths out of her children’s hearts, as well as “swine”-like folk who won’t just trample pearls (a biblical allusion) but also “rend” the “bowels” of those who throw them. The poem suggests the importance of maintaining one’s truth, at least internally; but it also acknowledges the countervailing need to protect oneself and one’s offspring from the often lethal treatment Pulter’s compatriots suffered in England’s civil wars (to which the poem also alludes).</note>
          </rdg>
          <rdg wit="#ae">
              <note type="headnote"><p>An essential element of Pulter’s emblem series is her shifting mode of address, as she directs her emblematic wisdom sometimes explicitly to her children, and sometimes to a broader audience. “Doves and Pearls”, like <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="68">Come, My Dear Children (Emblem 2)</ref>, addresses her children directly in an emblematic reworking of the invitation genre.</p><p>The emblem opens with Pulter imploring her children to notice the acts of doves, who by nature display loving devotion to one partner. The doves swallow orient pearls, which she uses as an emblem of a sacred “cordial, which our greatest faintings ease”, and she goes on to urge her readers to “treasure sacred truths within [the] heart”, as the doves do (lines 4, 6). The emblem moves to warn readers of “those swine” which, conversely, disregard “God’s word”; here, Pulter is inspired by multiple biblical references which cast swine as irreligious. An analogous emblem to this one is <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="99">Mark but those Hogs (Emblem 34)</ref>, in which Pulter contrasts the image of “thankless” hogs “grunt[ing] for more” with “innocent doves” (lines 4, 6, 17). In that emblem, she urges the reader to “try which best he loves / To imitate, base hogs or turtledoves”, and concludes with an expression of her “soul’s sole desire” to embody the same qualities as the “spotless dove” (lines 19–20).</p><p>Towards the final lines of “Doves and Pearls” Pulter’s religious concerns become explicitly political as she criticizes the poor treatment of “sacred fane[s]” under the Protectorate, specifically referencing the use of St Paul’s Cathedral for irreligious activities (line 20). She further condemns republicans, referencing the treatment of “nobles”—meaning royalist soldiers—after the 1645 Battle of Naseby (line 24). In a typical display of emblematic didacticism, however, Pulter concludes in consolation, reminding her children that God will “[scourge] out” the unfaithful (line 26). By applying Pulter’s conceit of doves and pearls to this final resolution, the message becomes clear: keep faith and fidelity with God, unlike those who “ramp and rave” (line 16).</p>
