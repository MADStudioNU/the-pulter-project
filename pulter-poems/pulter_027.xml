Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

            <note type="editorialnote">My editions aim to make Pulter’s poetry accessible in two ways. First, I facilitate basic legibility through modernizing spelling and punctuation according to standard American usage and through glossing unfamiliar words, points of intertexuality, and relevant historical contexts. Second, I want to help readers perceive Pulter’s nuanced approach to form and image, both within individual poems and in the extended patterns and ideas that take shape over the course of the manuscript. With this in mind, I have incorporated interpretive readings of the poems into my notes to provide insight into how Pulter’s poetics work and to spur readers to participate in the value-adding work of bringing Pulter’s writing the attentive level of interpretation it deserves.</note>

              <note type="headnote">Written, it appears, before the revolutions of the 1640s endangered England’s King Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria—or at least before they ended the king’s life—this paean sees Pulter’s royalism at its most contented. The poem begins with conventional classical imagery and praise before shifting to a larger and revolving cosmic stage, where the victor’s crown which “encircle[s]” Charles’s brow is echoed in both the lowly “orbs” of Pulter’s ilk and the “shining spheres” she imagines the king and queen inhabiting after death. This brief poem outlines a theological version of the water cycle, where truth, peace, and grace fall from heaven to sluice through virtuous rulers into humbler humans, before the worthy all evaporate upward into heaven’s glory, to become the source of blessings they once sought; but the collapse of social distinction envisioned in this almost impossibly distant future does not signal, to be clear, any desire on the poet’s part for political revolution on earth.</note>
          </rdg>
          <rdg wit="#ae">
              <note type="headnote">“On the King’s Most Excellent Majesty” is a densely allusive and highly ambiguous political poem. While on the surface the poem implies an encomium to Charles I and his wife Henrietta Maria, the speaker’s expressed desire for political stasis continually comes up against the inevitability of cycles of dissolution and transformation that are so central to Pulter’s poetry. Even as the poem articulates a Royalist longing for the continuation of Charles’s reign, it simultaneously suggests that such resistance to change is as outmoded as the geocentric model of the universe. The poem develops comparisons also made elsewhere in Pulter’s work between Charles I, the sun god Phoebus (the Roman equivalent of the Greek Apollo), and Julius Caesar. Its engagement with figures from Roman literature is in dialogue with the also notably ambivalent final book of Ovid’s <title rend="italic">Metamorphoses</title>, in which Caesar, like Charles and Henrietta Maria in this poem, is transformed into a star. Although this poem is written from a speaking-position located prior to the Interregnum, such ominous allusions to the death of a ruler suggest that this poem might have been written after Charles’s death. “On the King’s Most Excellent Majesty” also demonstrates the importance of women’s authority in Pulter’s work: Minerva is one of several recurring powerful female characters in Pulter’s collection. In this poem, she emphasizes the centrality of women’s roles in maintaining the state by creatively incorporating the myth of Apollo’s birth under the olive-tree that Minerva created, and by reworking Ovid’s depiction of a ruler’s apotheosis to include Henrietta Maria, treating her as equal to Charles in terms of her significance to the fate of the country. The queen is not mentioned in the title of this poem, but its structure serves to equate her importance with that of the king, turning from praise for Charles in the first eight lines to praise for Henrietta Maria, and finally collapsing both into a third-person collective “they” in the final eight lines.</note>

            <rdg wit="#ae">Victorious <seg>palm<note type="critical">The palm branch is a symbol of victory in the Roman tradition and also alludes to the Christian passion narrative. The palm bears special relevance to the references and images in this poem and throughout Pulter’s manuscript. The palm tree is where the phoenix, a recurring character in Pulter’s poetry, rebirths itself (see Ovid, <title rend="italic">Metamorphoses</title>, trans. Rolfe Humphries (Bloomington: Indiana UP, 2018), XV.393-98). Additionally, the sun god Phoebus, whom Pulter frequently uses as a figure for Charles I, was said to have been born between a palm tree and an olive tree on the island of Delos. Phoebus is thus sometimes referred to as “Delius,” while his twin sister Diana, is called Delia (see <title rend="italic">Metamorphoses</title> VI.333-337). In Pulter’s collection, however, “Delia” is consistently used to refer to Phoebus rather than his sister, as in line 16 of this poem. Additionally, according to Christian tradition, palm branches were waved and strewn in the path of Christ at his entrance into Jerusalem on the Sunday before his death (known as Palm Sunday), a connection that weaves an ominous undertone into this hopeful encomium. The phoenix, the cyclically returning sun, and the resurrected Christ all might imply Charles I’s rebirth through his son at the restoration of the monarchy.</note></seg>, triumphing <seg>laurel<note type="gloss">The laurel, like the palm, is also a Roman symbol of victory closely associated with Apollo. He is often depicted wearing a laurel wreath. Virgil describes the tree, also one of Caesar Augustus’ (r. 27 BCE-14 CE) favored symbols, as sacred to Apollo. See Virgil, <title rend="italic">Aeneid</title>, trans. Frederick Ahi (Oxford: Oxford UP, 2007), 7.59-63 and note to ln. 71 on p. 383.</note></seg> boughs,</rdg>

            <rdg wit="#ae"><seg>Encircles round<note type="critical">The phrase “encircle round”—along with the subsequent “our humble orbs” (7), “shining spheres” (13), and “by the primum mobile turned round” (15)—incorporate one of the most dominant motifs in Pulter’s manuscript: the circle. Pulter typically uses the circle to grapple with her inevitable mortality, imagining the dissolution of the body into its elemental form and the celestial afterlife of the soul. See, for example, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="16">The Revolution</ref>, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="17">The Circle [1]</ref>, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="21">The Circle [2]</ref>, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="25">The Circle [3]</ref>, and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="36">The Circle [4]</ref>. Her transposition of this conceit to the context of the rise and fall of monarchs in this poem exemplifies Pulter’s portrayal of the personal and the political as closely intertwined.</note></seg> <seg>illustrious<note type="critical">Illustrious most overtly means “famous.” However, like another of Pulter’s favorite terms, “influence,” the word at once evokes the ruler’s power and imagines him as an empty vessel directed by outside forces. Pulter cannily plays with this paradox: she frequently employs morphological variations on the word “illustrate” when discussing Charles I. This collocation invites the reader to consider the relationship between the astronomical phenomena of the natural world and the reigns of rulers. The term “illustrious” is ambiguous with regard to agency: it depicts the monarch as a powerful enlightening influence while also making him a passive receptacle who is filled with that “luster” by a higher power; cf. <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="8">On that Unparalleled Prince Charles the First, His Horrid Murder</ref>: “Unless our God doth a second Charles illustrate / (Which oh, deny not), all our hopes are frustrate” (35-36).</note></seg> <seg>Caesar’s<note type="critical">Although “Caesar” was the title given to Roman rulers, Pulter, like many of her contemporaries, often uses the term to refer to English monarchs, in this case, Charles I. Pulter also refers to Charles I as Caesar in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="13">Upon the Imprisonment of His Sacred Majesty</ref>, where she writes, “And thy o’erflowing vengeance thunder down / On these usurpers of our Caesar’s crown” (5-6). The fact that “Caesar” was often used to refer to Julius Caesar in particular is especially relevant given this poem’s similarities to Book XV of Ovid’s <title rend="italic">Metamorphoses</title>, in which the palm and laurel also serve as central images, and which tells the story of Caesar’s transformation into a star, like that of Charles I and Henrietta Maria in this poem. See <title rend="italic">Metamorphoses</title> XV.837-848.</note></seg> brows,</rdg>

            <rdg wit="#ae">Let bright <seg>Minerva’s<note type="critical">Pulter apparently emends the name originally copied out in the manuscript, “Pallas.” Pallas may refer to Minerva (i.e. the Greek goddess Athena), the Roman goddess of wisdom and war, a correction consistent with Pulter’s specific engagement with Roman literature and history in this poem. The original version of the line may have been intended to refer not only to Athena/Minerva but also to a character in the <title rend="italic">Aeneid</title> named Pallas, to whom Aeneas extends an olive branch as a sign of peace. See VIII.110-16.</note></seg> <seg>olive tree<note type="gloss">The olive tree is a symbol of both peace and victory. In Virgil’s <title rend="italic">Aeneid</title>, Aeneas offers Evander’s son Pallas an olive branch as a sign of peace (see note 6 above). In <title rend="italic">Metamorphoses</title>, Ovid recounts how Minerva won Athens in a contest with Neptune by causing an olive tree to rise from the ground, which she gifted to the city (VI.70-102).</note></seg> <seg>still grow<note type="critical">The word “still” can mean “consistently,” here expressing the speaker’s desire for the monarch’s reign to continue uninterrupted into the future. Yet “still,” in the sense of “unmoving,” paradoxically also implies a desires for stasis that is at odds with the “grow[th]” with which the word is paired. This tension suggests that the speaker’s desire that the kingdom will remain unchanged is doomed to be disappointed by the inevitable cycles of growth and transformation so central in Pulter’s work.</note></seg></rdg>
