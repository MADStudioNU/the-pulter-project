See Sarah C. E. Ross, “Women and Religious Verse in English Manuscript Culture, d. 1660-1668: Lady Anne Southwell, Lady Hester Pulter and Katherine Austen” (D.Phil. dissertation, University of Oxford, 2000), pp. 161-168.</note></seg></rdg>

                        The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers,
                        which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and
                        punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might
                        otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not
                        modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote
                        aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by
                        Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to
                        allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various
                        possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure
                        material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford
                        Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s
                        edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The
                        result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.

                      <p>My priority in editing these poems has been to modernise, and to achieve interpretative and visual clarity, in order to make the poems as accessible as possible to as wide a modern audience as is possible. Spelling is modernised, as is punctuation. Modernising the latter, in particular, often involves a significant act of editorial interpretation, but in my view this is one of the most productive areas of editorial intervention, particularly for a manuscript text such as Pulter’s where the punctuation is erratic compared to modern usage (and, indeed, compared to early modern printed texts).<seg>1<note type="critical">1.

                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">Ill and despondent, the speaker fantasizes about death, urging her soul to blast out of her body and travel through the galaxies to join God in eternity. This short poem of four stanzas (written in rhyming tercets), breaks in the middle, as the speaker suddenly reverses her directive to her soul. Because the creator requires it, she must remain on earth and limit her own creations to this sphere. The abbreviated final couplet formally demonstrates the constriction the speaker feels in being confined on earth and bound to her body. Yet her renewed commitment to “breathe nothing forth” but thanks and praise notably reflects back to her collection’s title, <bibl><title rend="italic">Poems Breathed Forth By the Noble Hadassah</title></bibl>, demonstrating that she has indeed fulfilled part of this creative promise. The poem is the latest dated poem in the collection, written eleven years before Pulter died.</note></rdg>
                <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">
                  <p>This poem is in a different hand from the main scribe’s, and is one of several added to the manuscript after the conclusion of the main series of poems (which concludes with “To Sir William Davenant, Upon the Unspeakable Loss of the Most Conspicuous and Chief Ornament of his Frontispiece” (Poem 60)). The same hand has transcribed “On the Fall of That Grand Rebel, the Earl of Essex” (Poem 62) and “Dear God, from Thy High Throne Look Down” (Poem 63), both of which are on a bifolium that has been tipped into the manuscript. “Made when my Spirits were Sunk Very Low” is copied into the main bound volume.</p>
                  <p>One of Pulter’s many poems composed in “sickness and sorrow”, this is a simple devotional lyric that looks forward to “everlasting life and day”, after death. Like many of Pulter’s devotional lyrics, this one exhorts her soul to “Droop not” with the sorrows of the world, and instead to turn to the divine; see, for example, “Universal Dissolution” (Poem 6) for a comparable incitement away from religious complaint, and “My Soul’s Sole Desire” (Poem 29) for a comparable focus on singing “hallelujahs to thy praise” (Poem 29, line 14). In its movement from addressing the drooping soul of the first stanza to envisaging the soul’s rousing ascent in the second, the poem could be compared to George Herbert’s “Easter Wings”; however, the ascent of the soul is “stay[ed]” in the third stanza, where the speaker insists on the soul’s need to see out the “few and evil days” of life on earth. The final couplet reflexively evokes Pulter’s devotional lyrics themselves, as the thanks and praise that Pulter’s speaker breathes forth while here on earth. Poem 45, “This Was Written 1648”, makes explicit the connection implicit here between the earthly songs of praise that are Pulter’s devotional lyrics, and the hallelujahs to be sung in the afterlife: “I’ll such lays here begin, shall end above” (Poem 45, line 68).</p>
                  <p>The poem’s form, in rhyming tercets with a final rhyming couplet, is song-like; for a broad comparison, see see “My Soul’s Sole Desire” (Poem 29), and the commentary to the amplified edition of that poem. This lyric, however, is metrically irregular, moving between tetrameter and pentameter lines. It is just possible that the text is a copy of a draft or unpolished poem, appearing as it does in a different hand, after the main series of poems in the manuscript.</p>
