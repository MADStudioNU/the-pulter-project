            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

              <note type="editorialnote">In my editions, I prioritize accessibility and multiple interpretive possibilities. To prepare these poems for a wide range of readers, I have modernized erratic early modern spelling, punctuation, and capitalization to conform to standard American usage. I gloss archaic definitions and confusing syntax, and I expand contractions, unless needed to maintain the integrity of the poem’s form. My notes investigate how Pulter’s poems engage with the literature and culture of mid-seventeenth-century England. At the same time, I emphasize how her poems are unique, how they respond to one another and seem to reveal their author’s individual circumstances and philosophies. When a note relies on Alice Eardley’s edition of <title rend="italic">Pulter’s Poems, Emblems, and The Unfortunate Florinda</title> (Toronto: Iter, 2014), I cite her text generally as “Eardley.” Although my own interests guide my editorial decisions, I aim to facilitate multiple readings rather than to direct interpretation in a restrictive way. It is worth noting that although Pulter’s poems survive in only one known source, they are not necessarily stable texts. The source manuscript features variants and revisions that invite multiple interpretations. I encourage readers to refer to the manuscript transcriptions and images on this site; my notes alert readers when the manuscript’s original spelling or physical features are especially worth considering.</note>

            <note type="headnote">“This monster … survived twenty-four husbands. My uncle Edward P. did know her.” This marginal note appears in the scribal hand, but is surely in Pulter’s voice; we might therefore feel entitled to presume she proffers herself as both exemplar and counsellor to the women she addresses: “pass your idle times / As I do now, in writing harmless rhymes.” While a widowed bird, loyal to her dead mate, is this rhyme’s opening focus, Pulter’s attention soon shifts from birds to beasts in human form, such as the prolifically wedded woman her uncle once knew. Both the male and female of the species come in for scorn: the men for rambling and gambling in seedy city locales—parks, theaters, taverns—and their wives for following them there. Women are instead enjoined to be loyal like the turtledove: but wouldn’t such loyalty precisely entail following their mates, wherever they might go? Not by Pulter’s lights: her plan calls for staying home and being loyal in love primarily to God. Yet, as so often in Pulter’s verse, this emblem also resists the confinement of such a life, most notably (and startlingly) in characterizing the repeated widowing of the “Belgic beast” as enfranchisement, and marriage as slavery.</note>
          </rdg>
          <rdg wit="#ae">
              <note type="headnote">This poem invites readers to imagine the turtledove (a small, timid, migratory bird with a plaintive song) as a model of loyalty and mourning. It advises widows to guard their sexual reputations by remaining chaste and avoiding places of ill repute, but also to embrace the creative freedom and time for religious devotion that widowhood enables. The poem is part of a section in Pulter’s manuscript titled “Emblems.” Emblem books were popular in early modern Europe, especially as teaching tools, but few women wrote in the genre. Although emblems typically combine a symbolic picture with text to create a pithy moral message, Pulter’s emblems include no images. Her turtledove emblem embraces the genre’s emphasis on moral instruction but refers more explicitly to contemporary politics and society, including allusions to specific English women and London sites. Toward the end of the poem, Pulter draws attention to her position as a female author when she advises other women to find pleasure in writing “harmless rhymes” as she does. Whereas Pulter writes often to or about her children, she rarely writes about her husband. Together with her description of her nuptial bed and Arthur’s nobility, beauty, and virtue in their early years together in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="44">A Solitary Discourse</ref>, the following poem is also noteworthy for its insistence that she models marital constancy. Although other Pulter poems prefer the country to London, this emblem’s recommendation that women should remain at home seems odd coming from a poet who regularly lamented her own seclusion at her country estate. We could interpret this poem as rationalizing her own experience or as exposing the limits of a biographical reading that privileges a consistent writing subject.</note>

          <rdg wit="#ae">Who can but pity this poor <seg>turtledove<note type="critical">Pulter elsewhere describes the turtledove as a widow, “Who mourning sits upon a withered spray” (<ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="43">Of a Young Lady at Oxford, 1646</ref>, line 11) and as “The mild and tenderhearted turtledove / That was so constant to her only love / Though she resolves to have no second mate, / Yet she her flight about the air doth take” (<ref corresp="57" type="pp-poem-ref">Why Must I Thus Forever Be Confined</ref>, lines 65-68). Pulter might have drawn on Biblical references that associate the turtledove with poverty, pity, and lamentation. The Psalms provide a pertinent example of mourning turtledoves who escape a sinful city (Psalm 55:1-11, King James Version), along with the line: “O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever” (Psalm 74:19, King James Version). Pulter also might have been familiar with Philemon Holland’s English translation of Pliny’s Natural History, which describes doves as devoted to their mates.</note></seg>,</rdg>

The same author, in <title rend="italic">The Art of Longevity, or, A Diaeteticall Instit[ut]ion</title> (London, 1659), praises “dear Oxford Kate” (a name which puns on “cate,” a term for a delicacy) for food and drink which “at the length will bring us unto Dis,” or hell (p. 42).</note></seg></rdg>
