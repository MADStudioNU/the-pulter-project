For example, what according to modern usage is incorrect subject/verb agreement might have been deemed acceptable to a seventeenth-century scribe or compositor. All such instances are treated instead using the ORIG and REG tags. (See below.)</p>
          <p>Corrections and annotations made within the scope of the original document either by its original authors, owners, and/or transcribers are noted using ADD tags.

            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>
          <rdg wit="#ae">
            <note type="editorialnote">The manuscript text is very sparsely punctuated. The only marker of syntax is a comma after “Heaven” (l. 5). There are brackets around “At which . . . soule) (l. 4) and “Ay mee” (l. 42), and they are also used to indicate the triple rhymes at lines 38-40, 43-5. An early modern form of the question mark appears in “How could they do it;” (l. 9). The scribe indicates a few omitted letters with inverted commas (“Spirit’s” (l. 4), “adorn’d” (l. 7), “outshin’d” (l. 29), “rais’d” (line 34), “defender’s” (l. 40)), and there is one contraction (“w:ch” for “which,” l. 43). There are slips of the pen in “splendenc^ie” (l. 29) and “imMortality” (l. 37). For the present text, punctuation has been inserted and spelling changed to modern usage. However,  the page images are easily available and make it possible to understand the experience of early readers, with the page layout highlighting the structure of the couplets, and capitalization often highlighting balanced words: this is not just something said but something made.</note>

              <note type="headnote">Grief management in the face of public atrocities is a relatively new industry, but Pulter tried her hand at it in this poem, as well as the one before it in the manuscript; both were written as responses to the king’s execution by political opponents. Like the last poem, this one also begins with a ban on grieving <hi rend="italic">wrongly</hi>—in this case, by continuing to mourn the executions of three royalist commanders: George Lisle; Charles Lucas (both lamented in an earlier poem, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="7">On Those Two Unparalleled Friends, Sir George Lisle and Sir Charles Lucas, Who Were Shot to Death at Colchester</ref>); and Arthur Capel, Pulter’s cousin-in-law. The enormity of the king’s death monopolizes all possible sighs and tears, sparing none for even such remarkable, but still lesser, lights. Pulter allows herself, early on, an outburst of baffled rage at those she could only regard as assassins: “How could they do it?” But soon the poem grows boldly to encompass more than her isolated, frustrated voice, through her ventriloquy of a mourning national church answered by divine assurance of a “second Charles”: possibly a prophetic claim, depending when the poem was written.</note>

However, the placement of the parenthetical phrase immediately after the reference to the king might also suggest that the speaker (or her soul) trembles–perhaps from fearful respect or awe–at the mere thought of her king, alive or dead.</note></seg> is dead,</rdg>
