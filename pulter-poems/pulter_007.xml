Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/l/transcript-conventions">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note></rdg>
                  <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/l/elemental-conventions">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>
                    <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="editorialnote">My “amplified” editions seek to make the poems as accessible as possible by modernizing spelling and punctuation and providing only brief definitions for words, while discursive notes and the materials I gather for the “curations” section place Pulter’s poems into conversations. As I build the curations for a given poem—provisional and quirky as they are—I keep returning to the poem, re-reading, rethinking, and adding layers to the notes. I hope to show that Pulter was intellectually and politically embedded rather than isolated, taking up issues, genres, and tropes that also interested her contemporaries and that sometimes accrue unpredictable salience in later periods. Rather than focusing only on possible sources or influences, I cast a wide net both within the seventeenth century and outside it, trying to catch cultural materials Pulter might have engaged, some she excludes or ignores, and even some she probably could never have imagined. Curations don’t precede the poems nor are they implied by the poems—as if the poem gathers them to itself (although it can sometimes feel that way) or hales them forth. Instead, as a curator I weave the poem into a web of relations, seeking to open out rather than close down interpretive possibilities. This extends to including extracts that are long enough that readers might find things therein that I do not anticipate. I also look for a multi-vectored traffic among Pulter’s poetry and the other materials. What might the materials I’ve gathered help readers see in the poems—or notice is not there? But also, how do the poems bring fresh perspectives into the conversations into which I draw them? The more one reads the poems as participants in wider ranging conversations, the more fascinatingly twisty Pulter appears. Often, I don’t grasp how she upends or comes at conventions aslant until I have mucked about composting my “curations.”</note></rdg>

                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">Death by firing squad, without trial: this is not an uncommon fate for political actors in the centuries since England’s civil wars in the 1640s. This poem laments an early example of such a fate in George Lisle and Charles Lucas, friends and royalist commanders who failed to defend the besieged town of Colchester against the parliamentary army. On the same day as their surrender, they were found guilty of treason by that army’s commander and promptly executed. Pulter, a staunch royalist, deplores the injustice of that sentence and those who appointed themselves jury and judge of the two men she idealizes here. She embeds this recent and evidently shocking turn of events (in a war which was likely ongoing when she wrote) in an ennobling mythological framework by suggesting that the coordination of Lisle’s and Lucas’s deaths arose from the admiration of their “constant love” by the Parcae or Fates. The poem ends by lambasting the opponents of the royalists as bloodthirsty monsters whose behaviour will, in the end, be its own curse; Pulter thus eagerly anticipates the oblivion of her political enemies in contrast to the endless fame and glory she at once prophesies for Lisle and Lucas and enacts within this poem.</note></rdg>
                <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">Pulter here responds to a controversial recent event. But she does so by writing in the long tradition of elegaic poetry, combining classical allusion and the charged language of Royalist polemic. Sir Charles Lucas and Sir George Lisle were Royalist commanders who were arrested and executed at Colchester on August 28, 1648, at the end of a protracted siege on the town by Parliamentary forces that had begun June 12th. That siege, which starved residents, driving them to desperate extremes, has been called “a central event of the second civil war and a focus of national attention in private letters and public print” (Barbara Donegan, <title rend="italic">War in England</title>, 1642-49 [Oxford UP, 2008], 313). In Pulter’s manuscript, the phrase in the title, “who were shot to death at Colchester,” was added in a different hand, perhaps suggesting that a later reviewer of the manuscript felt that other readers might need a bit more information to understand the poem’s occasion. At the time Pulter wrote, however, everyone was talking about the execution of Lucas and Lisle. It prompted controversy and outrage from the start; that controversy extended into the nineteenth century, when a monument to the two was erected. Was this a murder or an execution? What are the rules of war? Were Lucas and Lisle shot simply for being Royalists? (Margaret Lucas Cavendish later wrote that her brother, Charles, was “shot to death for his loyal service.”) Or were they court-martialed for a military offence, breach of parole? Commander Thomas Fairfax, who ordered the shooting, had previously captured and released both Lucas and Lisle on two separate occasions, each time securing a pledge that they would not again take up arms against Parliamentary forces. They had clearly broken that promise. Was Fairfax justified or not? Fairfax and his supporters struggled to defend his action, especially because he did not try Lucas and Lisle. Fairfax emphasized that they had not yet been granted “fair quarter” (the promise of clothes, food, and immunity from violence while prisoners) but had surrendered themselves to his mercy, meaning not that they were guaranteed mercy but that they were <hi rend="italic">at</hi> his mercy. Fairfax justified the action as “some satisfaction to Military Justice, and in part of avenge for the innocent blood they have caused to be spilt” in the course of the siege (<title rend="italic">A Letter from Lord Fairfax Concerning the Surrender of Colchester</title> [1648]). While Royalists like Pulter viewed Lucas and Lisle as martyrs, accounts of the siege and execution more sympathetic to the Parliamentary cause blamed Lucas for attracting the army to Colchester in the first place (Colchester was the site of the Lucas family home, St. John’s, a former abbey), and for instigating the siege and abusing the residents. Pulter’s subject, then, is one that had inspired many other writers. In her poem on the execution of Charles I, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="15">Let none sigh more for Lucas or for Lisle</ref>, Pulter demonstrates how quickly the target of mourning had shifted. Just months after the shooting of Lisle and Lucas, in January 1649, the regicide eclipsed that earlier outrage. Andrea Brady argues that the two men’s deaths were widely depicted as “sacrificial prologues to the king’s execution” (“Dying with Honour: Literary Propaganda and the Second English Civil War,” <title rend="italic">The Journal of Military History</title> 70.1 [2006]: 9-30, p. 11). Pulter presents them as soldiers and heroes, yes, but also as friends and even lovers.</note></rdg>

The question also advises us of the uncertain status of news at this time. The poem’s account of the deaths and the language it uses to describe the Parliamentary forces suggest that Pulter had access to popular print accounts. But the opening question also conveys a sense of doubt about what one hears through rumor and cheap print. The unstable tenses—it happened and is happening—make the incredible news newly traumatic. Pulter’s  use of questions may also signal her debt to Milton’s elegy <title rend="italic">Lycidas</title> (1638).</note></seg> Oh say not so.</rdg>

Pulter places them in the tradition of idealized male friends, using this tradition to recast death as a kind of union. In her <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="43">Of a Young Lady at Oxford, 1646</ref>, a tale of a woman who killed herself when her fiancé died fighting for the king, Pulter again refers to Lucas and Lisle as models of true love between men in the tradition of Damon and Pythias, Castor and Pollux, Patroclus and Achilles:  “When lovely Lisle saw Lucas bleeding lie, / He on his trembling bosom straight did die. / Thus do these stories and these fables teach / And show to us how far our love may reach” (lines 65-66). See “Curations” for other contemporary sources of this vision of the two men. If civil war was often depicted as a form of fratricide, this idealization of male friendship exalts Royalists as fratriphilic. Pulter’s use of heroic couplets throughout the poem reinforces her coupling of the two heroes.</note></seg> at a blow?</rdg>

                    <rdg wit="#ae">Ah me, what horrid <seg>Hydra<note type="critical">The hydra, or many-headed monster, was often used to describe an unruly mob and to disparage and dehumanize collectivity. For example, Royalists described their opposition (made up of collectives including Parliament, the Army, and religious sects) as a Hydra. Since one of the labors of Hercules was slaying the Hydra, calling one’s opposition a Hydra suggested that it would be admirable, even heroic, to destroy the monster. Here, the Hydra has but one heart even if it has many heads, a heartless heart determined to kill Lucas and Lisle. Hydra is the subject governing and linking the two verbs “unite and part” in a kind of zeugma or syllepsis.</note></seg> had the heart</rdg>

Lucas and Lisle, in contrast, were not granted a trial. Some stories about Mars (Ares in Greek mythology) claim that he was the first to be put on trial for shedding blood. He killed Poseidon’s son Halirrhothius for raping his daughter; Poseidon had him tried before a jury of the twelve gods, the “best of gods” as opposed to those who judged Lucas and Lisle. The fragmentary accounts that survive suggest that it was the justice of his cause, as well as his history of “valor,” that led to his acquittal. One print account refers to Lisle and Lucas as “sons of Mars” (<title rend="italic">Another Bloudy Fight at Colchester</title> [London, 1648], 2).</note></seg></rdg>

While “Independents” referred to a distinct group with a very particular religious and political agenda, Pulter uses the term to lump together all who presume to set their own course. Similarly, Philocrates, in <title rend="italic">The Loyal Sacrifice: Presented in the Lives and Deaths of those two eminent-heroic patterns, for valor, discipline, and fidelity, the generally beloved and bemoaned, Sir Charles Lucas and Sir George Lisle, Knights</title> (n.p., 1648) refers to the “sundry Jewish Anarchial Synagogue rooks” supporting the Army and Parliament (11). It also refers to the Turks to emphasize the barbarity of the killing of Lucas and Lisle: “But never did any savage nation, were it <hi rend="italic">Turkish</hi> or any other heathen, execute the like tyranny and cruelty upon such frivolous pretenses (as is well observed) in <hi rend="italic">cold blood</hi>” (68). A dedicatory epistle to Sir John Lucas, Charles’s brother, begins with the claim that many Englishmen “are degenerated into the very faith, or rather perfidiousness of the Jew” (Demophilus Philanactos, <title rend="italic">Two Epitaphs, Occasioned by the Death of Sir Charles Lucas and Sir George Lisle, basely assassinated at Colchester</title> [1648], sig. DA2r). In Pulter’s poem here, the “horrid Hydra,” “Cursed Rabble,” “black army,” and “sacrilegious rout” all link the Parliamentary cause, the New Model Army, and their supporters as a disorderly mob.</note></seg>, made these gallants fall.</rdg>

Neither was especially old. Cromwell was forty nine years old at the time of the shooting, and Fairfax thirty six. One Royalist pamphlet describes “the ravenous and gripping claws of these Cannibal Cuckoos (the Parliament and Army) that are now devouring [the people], after they have pulled and polished them to the bare skins, [and] are now feeding upon their flesh, and picking their very bones, killing, destroying, and robbing them” (A2r). It specifies that the Parliamentary forces are all “vultures, harpies” and “such like ominous and unclean birds, that with their huge bodies and baleful wings have obscured our king, our peace, our happiness.” Such carrion birds conspire against the eagle, the phoenix, and other birds figuring royalty and royalism.

                    <rdg wit="#ae">As those <seg>two famous thunderbolts of war<note type="critical">Virgil referred to two Roman generals, both named Cornelius Scipio, as “twin thunderbolts of war” (duo fulmina belli, <title rend="italic">Aeneid</title> 6.842). Aeneas encounters them in the underworld, so they are already dead, their achievements behind them. Because the first Scipio defeated the general Hannibal, despite his reputation for military strategy and his extensive human and animal forces (including elephants), he earned the nickname “Scipio Africanus.” The other Scipio was his adopted grandson. In a later war, he defeated Carthage and, famously, burned it to the ground and devastated its agricultural fields. Lucretius uses the story of these two indomitable generals to remind readers that even great warriors come to dust. “Scipio’s son, the thunderbolt of war, / Horror of Carthage, gave his bones to earth, / Like to the lowliest villein in the house” (<title rend="italic">De rerum Natura</title>, trans. William E. Leonard [Boston: E. P. Dutton, 1916], 3.1038-40). Lucy Hutchinson’s translation of Lucretius elaborates that “in a cold bed / Of earth his bones were laid, nor in the grave / Enjoy more privilege than the meanest slave” (<title rend="italic">The Works of Lucy Hutchinson</title>, ed. Reid Barbour and David Norbrook [Oxford University Press, 2012], 3.1117-19). One edition of this poem suggests that the two thunderbolts might refer to Castor and Pollux, to whom Pulter elsewhere compares Lucas and Lisle.

                    <rdg wit="#ee">Yet <seg>some sad swan<note type="critical">an allusion (in Ariosto’s <title rend="italic">Orlando Furioso</title>) to the story of swans in the afterlife who ferry the names of a few dead to a temple of immortal fame (Eardley)</note></seg>, I know, there will be found</rdg>
                    <rdg wit="#ae">Yet some <seg>sad swan<note type="critical"> The reference here to the sad swan may refer to the belief that swans sing before they die.  Writers as early as Pliny called this into doubt: “Some say that the swans sing lamentably a little before their death, but untruly, I suppose: for experience in many hath showed the contrary” (<title rend="italic">The History of the World. Commonly Called the Natural History</title>, trans. Philemon Holland [London, 1601], 10.3. sig. Bb3v). Yet the belief underpins an expression still in use, the “swan song,” or final performance. The speaker may express the hope that she herself may be this sad swan, dying after she puts her grief into verse, and achieving recognition “only” for this “one action” of commemorating the heroes.</note></seg> I know there will be found</rdg>
