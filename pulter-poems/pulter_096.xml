            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

                <p>This Amplified Edition seeks a middle ground between the reading texts of previous editions: Alice Eardley’s and Leah Knight and Wendy Wall’s respective modernizations and Stefan Christian’s semi-diplomatic transcription. The aim of this edition is to provide a text that is accessible to the modern reader while also retaining some idiosyncrasies of the original manuscript. In particular, this edition has retained the manuscript’s capitalization, a so-called “accidental” feature of a text (that is, one whose change or modernization does not affect meaning). Retaining the original capitalization in this Amplified Edition defamiliarizes the text without deterring the reader from understanding, and also highlights alliterative patterns that are perhaps more visually conspicuous in the original. One exception is the name “Domitian,” which is not capitalized in the original but is capitalized in this edition in order to clarify that the word is a proper noun. More broadly, spelling has been modernized according to Canadian standard usage. The names of biblical and classical figures have been regularized with one notable exception: the variant spelling of “Escalus,” preserving the capital E which is prominent in the early lines of the poem. All manuscript corrections have been silently incorporated, and contractions have been silently expanded, except where they might influence metre: for example, “Towring” is retained as “Tow’ring” whereas “Sacrifis’d” has been changed to “Sacrificed.” Punctuation has been modernized in order to clarify the sense, tone, and interrelationship of clauses.</p>
                <p>The explanatory notes for this edition expand on those provided in the editions specified above. Given the abundance of biblical and classical allusions in this poem, the notes frequently draw directly on source material in order to highlight significant parallels that may be latent between Pulter’s allusions. The notes provide readers with avenues for further research, and biblical references correspond with the King James Bible (1611).</p>
                <p>The editor thanks Liza Blake, Leah Knight, Wendy Wall, and the anonymous reviewers for their generous and illuminating feedback, and Sam Nguyen for encoding this Amplified Edition.</p>

              <note type="headnote">It is a mistake to want to know your fate, Pulter argues here. Once you do, you’ll want to change it, and you can’t; a destiny foreknown is not forestalled. Her first exhibit is a fellow poet, whose attempt to outwit the prediction that he’d die from something falling from above only brings about such a death: he goes to an open field, where a plummeting turtle smashes in his skull. This seemingly unexpected death was, of course, expected, indeed predicted—as are all deaths, or as they should be, this <hi rend="italic">memento mori</hi> poem reminds us: while each of us will die, we cannot and should not inquire about the details, Pulter opines. Yet she herself is awfully tempted, if we can judge by how urgently (in the poem’s late-breaking, self-reflective turn) she implores that she should “never know [her] destiny,” and “not here anticipate [her] grave.” To do so, she frets, is to be buried alive: a paradoxical state reflecting a certain ambivalence, in this poem as in others, toward life and death on (and in) earth, and perhaps what follows too. Her projected solution is devotion to God’s purpose, which might reframe consciousness of mortality.</note>

          <rdg wit="#ae">
            <note type="headnote">
                <p>Derived from a Latin word meaning “that which has been spoken,” fate in this poem is conflated with death and intertwined with the prognostications of astrologers, prophets, and soothsayers. The biblical and classical figures referenced in this poem learn the details of their demise beforehand, yet not one of these figures escapes the universal fate nor—with one important exception—the promised particulars. The poem makes a lesson out of those who flout fate, from Jezebel who elevates herself in royal resplendence only to be defenestrated, to Caesar who mocks his soothsayer shortly before being stabbed. The irony that imbues these stories implicates pride as a kind of intrinsically fatal folly that underlies not only the presumption that one can evade fate but also the very desire to “Curiously pry” into one’s death, a desire with which the speaker grapples.</p>
                <p>The sharp, moralizing contrast drawn between ideal Christian and typical pagan responses to mortality is exemplified foremost by the poem’s augmentation of the emblem conventionally associated with Aeschylus. As Eardley notes, emblems traditionally consist of three parts: “a motto (<foreign rend="italic">inscriptio</foreign>), a printed image (<foreign rend="italic">pictura</foreign>), and a short epigrammatic verse (<foreign rend="italic">subscriptio</foreign>)” (27). While Pulter foregoes the formal elements of <foreign rend="italic">inscriptio</foreign> and <foreign rend="italic">pictura</foreign>, her emblematic verse exhibits didactic and ekphrastic tendencies. The spectacle in this case is the bizarre death of the tragedian Aeschylus, as recounted in Pliny’s <title rend="italic">Naturalis historia</title>, translated by Philemon Holland: when warned by divinators that he will die on a certain day by means of a falling object, Aeschylus ventures into an open field, “far from house or tree, presuming vpon the securitie of the clear and open skie” (<bibl><title rend="italic">The Historie of the World</title> [London, 1634], 271</bibl>). As if on cue, an eagle, seeking a hard surface on which to shell her prey, spots the poet’s shiny pate and drops a tortoise on his head. Pulter’s wry tone in these lines and her tongue-in-cheek aside on baldness accentuate the comic outlandishness of the situation. Though this particular emblem seems absent from the popular English collections of Whitney, Peacham, Quarles, and Wither, it does appear in a number of continental collections in the same period, and the mottos of this common emblem variously iterate that fate is inevitable and death, all-powerful.</p>
                <p>Pulter, however, diverges from these commonplaces in lines 14–16 by suggesting that the fate of death can be crossed by divine intervention. Such a reprieve, moreover, is obtained not via actions of avoidance but by an attitude of contrition: in contrast with the pagan, hell-bound Aeschlyus who presumes he can outwit what is fated, Hezekiah’s humble tears win him a temporary pardon from death. Despite his political missteps and spiritual faults, Hezekiah is memorialized as one of the few righteous Judean kings within the biblical narrative, upheld in early modern sermons and in works like John Donne’s <title rend="italic">Devotions</title> for his exemplary response to illness and impending death. When warned by the prophet Isaiah that his illness will be fatal, Hezekiah, rather than seeking the aid of physicians or other deities, “turn[s] his face to the wall” and tearfully prays for the Hebrew god’s intervention, invoking his past devotion and good works as cause for mercy (2 Kings 20:2–3; Isaiah 38:2–3). Listed as an ancestor of Jesus in the gospel of Matthew’s genealogy (1:10), the pre-Christian, imperfect, and yet righteous Hezekiah functions as an important analogue for the Christian speaker, who likewise strives to live righteously so that she may die “with comfort.” Like Hezekiah, the speaker ultimately prays for divine intervention into her “Sad Story,” but her request is not for a mere deferral of death but for a post factum reversal, that is, a glorious resurrection and carefree afterlife, and the fortitude to live her precarious, mortal life according to such a hope (thereby rising, too, from doubt and despair).</p>
                <p>The speaker’s portrayal of death as a welcome night’s rest for the weary, then, qualifies her aversion to foreknowledge with an underlying desire not shared by the other figures in the poem. Though she characterizes death as alluringly peaceful, the speaker nevertheless prays that she might not “anticipate [her] grave,” the verb <hi rend="italic">anticipate</hi> meaning to consider in advance—to foreknow and to fret over—but also, relatedly, to bring about or put into practice prematurely, like Aeschylus seems to do by trying to prevent his death. For the speaker, anticipation is contrary to the life of spiritual devotion upon which a good death is contingent and by which, with divine aid, a good death is possible. Precise foreknowledge is futile, even pernicious, not only if fate is fixed as per tradition but also if, as intimated by the exceptional “Unless” in line 14, fate is in flux, a working out of salvation.</p>

According to the Greek historian and geographer Strabo, the name Erycina is derived from the location of the goddess’s temple, the “lofty mountain” Eryx in Sicily (<title rend="italic">Geography</title> 6.1.7). Two subsidiary temples in Rome were dedicated to Venus Erycina, one on the Capitoline Hill and one near the Porta Collina: see <bibl>Anna Anguissola, “Note on Aphidruma 2: Strabo on the Transfer of Cults,” <title rend="italic">Classical Quarterly</title> 56, no. 2 (2006): 643–646</bibl>. Ariadne Staples contextualizes this cult alongside others devoted to Venus in <bibl><title rend="italic">From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins: Sex and Category in Roman Religion</title> (New York, 1998), 99–126</bibl>. That Aeschylus was a devotee of Venus Erycina appears to be Pulter’s own invention and a cheeky explanation for the poet’s baldness: in addition to the broader associations of Venus with romantic and sexual entanglement, the Erycine cult was specifically associated with prostitution (<bibl>Staples, 113, 122</bibl>). As Knight and Wall note, early modern humoral medicine linked baldness with overindulgence in sexual activity.</note></seg>—</rdg>

Tears are a powerful, generative motif in Pulter’s poetry, and line 30 of this poem reiterates their centrality to the speaker’s own response to her mortality: see the note to “Sighs and tears” (l. 30) for examples of this motif elsewhere in the manuscript. Though humble in contrast with the other figures in this poem, Hezekiah notably falls into pride soon after his miraculous recovery (2 Chronicles 32:24–26). Despite his shortcomings, however, he was viewed by early modern readers as an exemplary biblical figure, both in his leadership and his response to what is understood to have been a plague-like illness: see <bibl>Kevin Killeen, “Hezekiah, the Politics of Municipal Plague and the London Poor,” <title rend="italic">The Political Bible in Early Modern England</title> (Cambridge, 2016), 76–104</bibl>.</note></seg></rdg>

When the astrologer Ascletario foretold the manner of his own death, Domitian tried to have Ascletario killed in a different manner in order to prove the fallibility of divination. It is Domitian, however, who ultimately fails. His aversion to prophecy, moreover, appears to have stemmed from his youth when astrologers foretold both the hour and manner of his death. Even on the portentous day, Domitian sentenced a soothsayer to death for interpreting the city’s ongoing problem of lightning strikes as foreshadowing a change in rulers. Unbeknownst to Domitian, however, his friends had been conspiring to overthrow him and, knowing he feared the fifth hour of the day as the fatal one, they assured him it was the sixth when he inquired. Relieved, he dismissed his attendants, retired to his bedroom, and was promptly slain.

Another relevant definition is “To observe or practise in advance of the due date; to cause to happen earlier, accelerate,” which captures the futility (and irony) of attempting to prevent fate as demonstrated by the stories of Aeschylus and others in the poem (def. 5).
