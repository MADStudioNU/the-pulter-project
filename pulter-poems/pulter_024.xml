                        The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers,
                        which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and
                        punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might
                        otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not
                        modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote
                        aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by
                        Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to
                        allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various
                        possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure
                        material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford
                        Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s
                        edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The
                        result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.

                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">Servile vassal or heavenly monarch? The decision is God’s, the speaker states, in this poem that formally toys with creating and dissolving constraints. Pulter’s complaint about her spiritual abjection is described conventionally, as she confesses to being mere dust bound to a world of sin and pain. But the political vocabulary that she offers in muted form in Poem 20 (a verse in which the speaker similarly implores God for a heavenly crown) appears more overtly here. Unenfranchised, unfree, and in servitude, the speaker professes her readiness to “reign” with God in heaven. As in Poem 20, she offers the only gift to God that she feels she has at her disposal: the power to create songs of praise, which, in eternity, might take some new and unknown form. This is one of Pulter’s most intricate and experimental poems formally: one of only five in tercets, it uses rhyme to yoke stanzas into four pairs, each stanza concluding with a short dimeter line that visually stages contraction and deterioration on the page. This complex structure is offset, however, by extensive enjambment, which creates a breathless rush and a proliferation of clauses that refuses expected separations and terminations.</note></rdg>
              <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">This poem describes a speaker who longs to be released from the “darkness” of her earthly situation. As in several other poems, the contrast between the speaker’s current and desired state is figured by an opposition between night and day and/or darkness and light. Whereas in some poems (e.g., <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="22">To Aurora[1]</ref>) the speaker addresses Aurora as a mediating figure between light and darkness, this poem enjoins God directly and offers her own verse as recompense for His decision to free her. She promises to praise God for eternity in “unknown lays,” a complex phrase that draws attention to the experimental form of this poem (8 stanzas of tercets; see also <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="29">O, My Afflicted Solitary Soul</ref> and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="63">Dear God, from Thy High Throne Look Down</ref>) and opens meta-poetic questions about how Pulter imagined the nature of poetry and the audience for her work.</note></rdg>
