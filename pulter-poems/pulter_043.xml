The reference to the death of Sir George Lucas and Sir Charles Lisle later in the poem indicates that the poem must have been completed in 1648 or later; however, the date in the title suggests that the story in the first half of the poem may be associated with the siege of Oxford.</note></seg></rdg>

                        The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers,
                        which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and
                        punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might
                        otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not
                        modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote
                        aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by
                        Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to
                        allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various
                        possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure
                        material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford
                        Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s
                        edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The
                        result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.

                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">What was a young lady doing at Oxford in 1646? Shooting herself, according to Pulter, who reports what sounds like a cross between melodrama and a news bulletin of yet another example of the never-ending collateral damage of war. The speaker’s point, however, is not to regret this instance of self-murder, but to ennoble it through analogy with various other female suicides, before criticizing her own soul for lingering on earth despite allegedly loving Christ and seeking union with him in heaven. As part of a pep-talk to speed her own death, the speaker takes various rhetorical tacks. She recounts her inspired vision of the crucifixion, for instance, and compares Christ’s extraordinary heroism favorably with exemplary male friends who died for one another (since Christ outdid them by dying, not for his friends, but the “foes” of depraved humanity). All this is canvassed as part of the speaker’s somewhat haranguing campaign for her soul to leave her body without delay: a goal the young lady accomplished with the pull of a trigger, but which the Christian speaker, despite her evident admiration of this act and yearning for death, cannot achieve in the same manner while remaining loyal to her self-sacrificing (if not quite suicidal) “Redeemer.”</note></rdg>
                <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">In “Of a Young Lady at Oxford, 1646,” Pulter develops complex relationships between political, erotic, and religious registers. The poem’s title refers to the anecdote that takes up about the first third of the poem, which describes the deaths of an unnamed pair of lovers during the Siege of Oxford in 1646. When the Lady learns that her lover, a Royalist soldier, has died in battle, she takes her own life in imitation of famous female suicides, Lucrece and Thisbe. This exemplum of erotic devotion, which Pulter describes as “earthy love,” prompts the speaker’s reflection upon the state of her soul. In an extended apostrophe to her soul, the speaker questions how her soul can desire to stay on earth when Christ, the soul’s proper companion, has already left it. Pulter mirrors the anecdote in the first part of the poem with the examples of five pairs—brothers, friends, lovers, and soldiers—who are famous for their devotion and willingness to die for one another. These exempla raise questions about whether different forms of human devotion are models for (or imitations of) the soul’s desire for union with Christ. The middle of the poem, however, includes several Biblical allusions that frame and reframe the classical allusions that begin and end the poem. While the unnamed Lady and the famous male heroes sacrifice themselves for friends or lovers, Christ dies for humans who are enemies (“cursed foes”) by dint of their sins (Romans 5: 7-8), a sacrifice that informs the speaker’s final, urgent questioning of her own soul.</note></rdg>

The stories of both of these women have repeatedly been the subject of poetry. Ovid writes of Lucrece in book II of <title rend="italic">Fasti</title>, and Shakespeare adopts the story in <title rend="italic">The Rape of Lucrece</title> (1594). The earliest version of the Pyramus and Thisbe story is found in Ovid’s <title rend="italic">Metamorphoses</title> (book 4). Shakespeare uses this story for the plot of the play-within-a-play in <title rend="italic">A Midsummer’s Night Dream</title> and also adapts it in <title rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet</title>. Pulter updates these tales of heroic female suicide by including a modern weapon (the pistol).</note></seg>;</rdg>

I have not been able to identify a specific historical analogue for the anecdote of a young lady’s suicide in Oxford during the Civil Wars, though the mixture specific historical details with classical precedent suggests that more research is warranted. If this story is fictional, Pulter has invented her own “fable” to place beside the classical exempla cited in the poem. If the story is historical, it is notable that Pulter does not condemn the Lady’s suicide, but interprets it as evidence of her nobility of spirit.</note></seg>.</rdg>

While there is quite a bit of variation in the “love” demonstrated by each of these stories, the final pair is distinct because they are Pulter’s contemporaries. Lucas and Lisle were considered Royalist martyrs and were commemorated in numerous panegyrics and poems.
