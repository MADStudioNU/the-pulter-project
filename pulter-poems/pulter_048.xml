                        The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers,
                        which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and
                        punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might
                        otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not
                        modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote
                        aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by
                        Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to
                        allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various
                        possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure
                        material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford
                        Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s
                        edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The
                        result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.

                    <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="editorialnote">With an undergraduate and graduate student audience in mind, this poem has been modernised in spelling and punctuation. Where modernisation would affect form, priority has been given to the integrity of the poem’s formal features (so, for instance, verb endings -est and -eth have been retained unmodernised; where the meter requires it, the verb ending -ed is accented, e.g., “Then shall thy blessèd influence”). Nouns have been capitalized only when there is clear personification. The notes provide information essential to understanding the poem, while the Headnote aims to stimulate readers’ own interpretations through suggesting literary or historical contexts, possible influences, comparable poems (by Pulter and by her predecessors and peers) and relevant critical arguments.</note></rdg>

            <app type="headnote">
                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">Alluding to love sonnets that promise to immortalize a beloved in writing, Pulter, like John Donne, creates a 14-line poem with God as its object of devotion. The speaker cements this association by concluding with a promise to inscribe God in verse that glorifies him not only on earth (as her own poem currently does) but beyond, in some vast and yet unknown eternity. In fact, the speaker’s pleading for an infusion of heavenly light into her soul becomes a type of contract, since it is phrased contingently: if she is “irradiated” with divine spirit, she will be resurrected and able to produce songs that amplify God’s name (a proper name interestingly withheld in this mortal poem). Pulter’s vision of transformation includes an elemental recycling of elements: her body’s dissolution at death converts to ascend what she uniquely and vividly terms “the stairs of revolution,” the restless motions necessary for salvation.</note></rdg>
                <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">
                  <p>This poem explores one of Pulter’s key ideas, that life is circular (see <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="17">The Circle [1]</ref>, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="21">The Circle [2]</ref>, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="25">The Circle [3]</ref>, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="36">The Circle [4]</ref>; <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="16">The Revolution</ref>). Renewed in death by God, we undergo a “revolution”, a transformation of body and soul. This use of “revolution” is fascinating in a period which saw the word appropriated politically by radicals, parliamentarians, and royalists. On the interconnected ideas, and rhymes, of revolution and dissolution, see also <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="1">The Eclipse</ref>, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="6">Universal Dissolution</ref>, “The Revolution” (Poem 16), <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="40">My Soul, Why Art Thou Full of Trouble</ref> and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="47">Why Art Thou Sad at the Approach of Night</ref>. Pulter’s “stairs of revolution” is an unusual phrase and image. She imagines progress towards the Day of Judgment, when souls and bodies are reunited and can join God, as a kind of spiral staircase. Describing the stairs as “of revolution” suggests also an ongoing, or cyclical, transformation. The spiral staircase was already loaded with meanings related both to poetic form and faith. George Herbert used it to represent excessive ornamentation, “Is there in truth no beauty? / Is all good structure in a winding stair?” (“Jordan [1]”). Pulter’s usage is altogether more positive, though, imagining the winding stair as the path to resurrection and union with God. See also Pulter’s emblem poems where she uses the image of “steps” to represent both following in Christ’s footsteps and ascent to heaven (<ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="67">Mighty Nimrod (Emblem 1)</ref>; <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="68">Come, My Dear Children  (Emblem 2)</ref>).</p>
                  <p>While the poem is in couplets, its fourteen lines allude to sonnet form, and therefore the broader tradition of Petrarchan love poetry. Moreover, the promise of the final lines, to “magnify” the addressee’s name “Beyond the reach of all eternity”, evokes the promise (and boast) of immortality common to earlier sonnet sequences by Spenser and Shakespeare. In Sonnet 55, Shakespeare’s speaker had claimed “So, till the Judgement that yourself arise, / You live in this, and dwell in lovers’ eyes.” The beloved lives in “this”, the poem itself. While Shakespeare adopted the idea of the Day of Judgment for his secular love poem, Pulter places this theological concept at the heart of her poem. It is not the self-aggrandising poet who can “magnify” God’s name, but the resurrected believer: immortal, strong and glorious (1 Corinthians 15: 42-44).</p>
