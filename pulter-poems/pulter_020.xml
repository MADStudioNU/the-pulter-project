                        The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers,
                        which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and
                        punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might
                        otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not
                        modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote
                        aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by
                        Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to
                        allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various
                        possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure
                        material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford
                        Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s
                        edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The
                        result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.

                    <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="editorialnote">With an undergraduate and graduate student audience in mind, this poem has been modernised in spelling and punctuation. Where modernisation would affect form, priority has been given to the integrity of the poem’s formal features (so, for instance, verb endings -est and -eth have been retained unmodernised; where the meter requires it, the verb ending -ed is accented, e.g., “Then shall thy blessèd influence”). Nouns have been capitalized only when there is clear personification. The notes provide information essential to understanding the poem, while the Headnote aims to stimulate readers’ own interpretations through suggesting literary or historical contexts, possible influences, comparable poems (by Pulter and by her predecessors and peers) and relevant critical arguments.</note></rdg>

                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">This poem modulates between a desperate plea not to be abandoned and a vivid fantasy of becoming a heavenly (if dependent) power, whose glory is imagined as akin to royalty. The speaker’s anguished and repeated cries for God not to turn his face away echo both Christ’s tormented exclamation on the cross (“My God, my God why have thou forsaken me?”) and David’s entreaty in the Psalms (“Hide not thy face far from me; …  leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation”). If the divine spirit would possess and illuminate her soul, the speaker would reciprocate by offering earthly hallelujahs (songs of praise, such as this poem). This earthly illumination would also set into motion the “eternal day” of the Christian Judgment Day, when her body—gruesomely imagined as eaten by material elements—might transform into a new physical state wearing new garments. Pulter experiments in the poem formally, offering six four-line stanzas that interconnect in unusual ways: the individual stanzas are comprised of a tetrameter tercet and offset ending trimeter line; and end rhymes structure the poem as three paired stanzas. The result is a verse that demonstrates an intensified bonding and coupling of its parts.</note></rdg>
                <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">
                  <p>This poem draws on several key biblical uses of the “face”: in the Psalms, David wishes God’s face to be turned towards him (Psalm 27:9), in Genesis, the Holy Spirit moves upon the “face” of the seas as the world is created (Genesis 1:2), and that verb is picked up in lines 6-7 here. John Donne also played with similar imagery in “Good Friday 1613 Riding Westward,” though in his poem it is the believer who turns away his face from God (because travelling west on Easter day, and also because of his humility), until the poem’s final lines. As in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="65">The Hope</ref>, here Pulter embraces the idea of physical disintegration, suggesting that death of the body is rebirth of the soul. Pulter also incorporates the process of writing into the poem itself. In the second stanza the speaker writes her own “story” while also creating a devotional poem of praise: “I will hallelujahs sing.” The humility of Pulter’s account of her own writing echoes George Herbert’s. Her phrase “my eternal God and King” has biblical origins which Herbert also invokes when he defends plainness, albeit ingeniously, in “Jordan (1)”:</p>

                   <p> We might see the same mixture of humility and assertion in Pulter’s poem. When she modestly comments “here I <hi rend="italic">pass</hi> my story,” pass means “tell” or “relate” but it could also mean “surpass,” suggesting that Pulter’s speaker lives through (and beyond) her words.</p>
