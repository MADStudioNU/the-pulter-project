          <rdg wit="#ae"><seg>The Welcome [2]<note type="critical">The poem’s title invokes the popular early modern genre of hospitality poetry, such as the country house poem or the invitation poem. As is often the case in Pulter’s poetry, she plays with this genre by substituting a reflection on her isolation in place of the community typically at the center of these poems. On Pulter’s engagement with the pose of isolation popular in Royalist poetry during the Interregnum, as well as the political networks in which her position as the lady of a country estate likely would have involved her, see Karen Britland, “Conspiring with ‘friends’: Hester Pulter’s Poetry and the Stanley Family at Cumberlow Green,” <title rend="italic">The Review of English Studies</title> 609, no. 292 (November 2018): 832-54.</note></seg></rdg>

            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

            <note type="editorialnote">My editions aim to make Pulter’s poetry accessible in two ways. First, I facilitate basic legibility through modernizing spelling and punctuation according to standard American usage and through glossing unfamiliar words, points of intertexuality, and relevant historical contexts. Second, I want to help readers perceive Pulter’s nuanced approach to form and image, both within individual poems and in the extended patterns and ideas that take shape over the course of the manuscript. With this in mind, I have incorporated interpretive readings of the poems into my notes to provide insight into how Pulter’s poetics work and to spur readers to participate in the value-adding work of bringing Pulter’s writing the attentive level of interpretation it deserves.</note>

            <note type="headnote">Death is hailed as an old friend in this, the second of two poems so named. Both warmly address this usually-feared figure in casual diction which suggests the speaker’s utter comfort with her own mortality. An easy, homey analogy of dying with going to bed, however, soon collides with the more complex cosmology that is typical of much of Pulter’s verse. The result lets the speaker’s sense of humor (which depicts her posthumously taking a nap in oblivion) join with a serious vision of a more lasting, longed-for transformation of her being.</note>

          <rdg wit="#ae">
            <note type="headnote">The apparent simplicity of the short couplets and images of childhood that make up this brief poem are in tension with a persistent metrical irregularity that suggests resistant discomfort underlying the speaker’s overt claims to view death as a welcome, temporary rest.<seg>1<note type="critical">On Pulter desiring death, see Frances E. Dolan, <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="/poems/ae/the-desire/#desiring-death">Desiring Death</ref> (Curation for <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="18">The Desire</ref>) and <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="/poems/ae/to-aurora-3/#more-ruminations-on-death-and-resurrection">More Ruminations on Death and Resurrection</ref> (Curation for <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="34">To Aurora [3]</ref>), Elizabeth Scott-Baumann, <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="/poems/ae/the-hope/#dear-death">Dear Death</ref> (Curation for <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="65">The Hope</ref>), and Helen Smith, <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="/poems/ae/made-when-i-was-sick-1647/#the-good-death">The Good Death</ref> (Curation for <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="31">Made When I Was Sick, 1647</ref>) in <title rend="italic">The Pulter Project: Poet in the Making</title>, edited by Leah Knight and Wendy Wall (2018).</note></seg> Pulter’s rhyme scheme and inventive use of rhetorical devices realizes in poetic form how death can at once be a definitive end (echoed in her consistently endstopped couplets) and a transformation that brings something new into being out of earlier material (echoed in the inventive forms of repetition in her use of homoioteleuton [the repetition of word endings]  and antanaclasis [repeating a word but changing its meaning]). Like the earlier poem, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="19">The Welcome [1]</ref>, the poem approaches Pulter’s constant theme of her impending mortality from the persona of a hospitable hostess, a role not unlike that which Pulter would have played in her estate at Broadfield. The mood of this poem shifts rapidly in a short space, from domestic scenes of going to bed, to elemental dissolution in the alchemical urn, and finally to the apocalypse.</note>

          <rdg wit="#ae"><seg>Death, come<note type="critical">The spondee (a metrical foot consisting of two stressed syllables) that opens this poem is one of a handful of pointed metrical irregularities in what is otherwise fairly regular iambic pentameter. In this case, Pulter’s spondee both sonically underscores the somberness of her invocation of death, and amplifies the surprising shift in the remainder of the line from a funereal mood to one of sociability and hospitality.</note></seg>, <seg>and welcome<note type="critical">Pulter’s use here of homoioteleuton (i.e. the repetition of word endings) is the first of a number of rhetorical devices she deploys in this poem that play with forms of repetition. See also the notes on the end rhymes in lines 5-6 and 7-8. Taken together, these devices perform a transformation of the words of the poem that is analogous to death as envisioned by Pulter: not as a rupture but as a remaking of one’s substance into a new form.</note></seg>; thou art my ancient friend,</rdg>

At the same time, the irregular meter here may convey the singsong “cheerful” tone the line describes. These two implications together suggest that this attempt to evoke cheer in the face of death is uncomfortable and artificial.</note></seg> I’ll lay me down</rdg>

          <rdg wit="#ae">In dust as in the daintiest bed of <seg>down<note type="critical">Pulter’s use of antanaclasis—the repetition of a pair of homographs in two different senses, which is emphasized in the manuscript by the capitalization of both instances of the word “down”—is another example of her engagement in this poem with various forms of repetition as a means of meditating on how death at once transforms and preserves. In this case, the transformation she poetically enacts is not to the word as it is written, as in the first line, but rather to its meaning. In comparing laying herself “down” to die to a soft bed of “down,” Pulter further develops the poem’s central conceit of reframing death as gentle, familiar, and welcome.</note></seg>.</rdg>
