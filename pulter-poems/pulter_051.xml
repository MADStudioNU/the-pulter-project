Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>
                    <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="editorialnote">My “amplified” editions seek to make the poems as accessible as possible by modernizing spelling and punctuation and providing only brief definitions for words, while discursive notes and the materials I gather for the “curations” section place Pulter’s poems into conversations. As I build the curations for a given poem—provisional and quirky as they are—I keep returning to the poem, re-reading, rethinking, and adding layers to the notes. I hope to show that Pulter was intellectually and politically embedded rather than isolated, taking up issues, genres, and tropes that also interested her contemporaries and that sometimes accrue unpredictable salience in later periods. Rather than focusing only on possible sources or influences, I cast a wide net both within the seventeenth century and outside it, trying to catch cultural materials Pulter might have engaged, some she excludes or ignores, and even some she probably could never have imagined. Curations don’t precede the poems nor are they implied by the poems—as if the poem gathers them to itself (although it can sometimes feel that way) or hales them forth. Instead, as a curator I weave the poem into a web of relations, seeking to open out rather than close down interpretive possibilities. This extends to including extracts that are long enough that readers might find things therein that I do not anticipate. I also look for a multi-vectored traffic among Pulter’s poetry and the other materials. What might the materials I’ve gathered help readers see in the poems—or notice is not there? But also, how do the poems bring fresh perspectives into the conversations into which I draw them? The more one reads the poems as participants in wider ranging conversations, the more fascinatingly twisty Pulter appears. Often, I don’t grasp how she upends or comes at conventions aslant until I have mucked about composting my “curations.”</note></rdg>

            <app type="headnote">
                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">Today we talk about medically-assisted death. Here, the speaker imagines a poetically—or rhetorically—assisted death, as she urges the departure of her soul from her body. In her sickness, she asks why her soul won’t just go and let her die. This poem suggests the soul’s attachment to the body’s “prison” is itself unholy; and as though to quicken the dissolution and decay that she desires, the speaker dissects her body and mind. Her self-blazon, however, swerves between aversion and nostalgia, “mourning” her lost youth in many of the same terms as Pulter uses in grieving her daughter Jane in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="11">Tell Me No More [On the Same]</ref>. In a striking revision of one of the most common poetic conventions of love poetry, the speaker inventories her body parts—hair, lips, skin, breasts—and overlays a realistic aging body over the usual idealized comparisons. The poem’s repeated oscillation between glimpses of a beautiful golden age and the ruined present seem almost like a series of practice swings, pendulously building momentum for the soul’s anticipated onward movement, “away.”</note></rdg>
                <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">
                  <p>The title of this poem suggests that it will be a reflection on mortality prompted by illness, similar to those by poets including Donne and Herbert (see <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Illness and Poetry</ref>). To a certain extent it is. But Pulter’s poem differs from other reflections from the sickroom in two ways: 1) the speaker’s gaze dwells on her own body, past and present, struggling to shift the focus to the future, to the death and resurrection that she is supposed to desire and that animate other Pulter poems (such as <ref target="/" corresp="18" type="pp-poem-ref">The Desire</ref>); and 2) the speaker never directly addresses God. The poem is self-contained, a conversation between speaker and soul about the body. What Pulter produces here is a diptych self-portrait, braiding together a blazon of her beauties when young with an anti-blazon frankly assessing her body now, ravaged by illness, age, and grief. (On the blazon, see <ref target="https://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/#hester-pulter-and-english-blazon" type="new-window-url">Hester Pulter and the Blazon in Early Modern England</ref> in “Explorations”). The two pictures are not simply set side by side. Throughout, the speaker tempers the assertion that this body is a ruined prison she should be eager to abandon with puzzled ruminations on her attachment to it regardless. What’s curious here is that the poem suggests that it is the soul, so often depicted as imprisoned in the body and released by death, that mourns over the ruined body and wants to stay in it. The speaker keeps urging the soul to look at this body and thereby get over being attached to it; the tone verges on hectoring: “see’st thou these eyes?” (line 3). The poem begins and ends with questions to the soul: why does it mourn the decaying flesh? Why does it want to stay in the world? The sharp observation driving the poem suggests one reason: an attachment to the specifics of the body, now as well as then.</p>
                  <p>Particular hostility focused on women’s aging bodies in the early modern period. An old woman often appeared in allegories of vanity, looking into or out of a mirror (see <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Aging Women</ref>). John Gaule warns that “every old woman with a wrinkled face, a furrowed brow, a hairy lip, a gobber [buck] tooth, a squint eye, a squeaking voice, or a scolding tongue … is not only suspected, but pronounced for a witch” <bibl>(John Gaule, <title rend="italic">Select Cases of Conscience Touching Witches and Witchcraft</title> [London, 1646], 5)</bibl>. While today it is often said that aging women are culturally invisible, Pulter insists on seeing the aging female body and pointing out its features to the soul—and to the reader. The speaker regrets what she sees, but never looks away.</p></note></rdg>

                    <rdg wit="#ae">This loathsome ruined <seg>prison to forsake<note type="critical">It was conventional to describe the body as the soul’s prison, usually so as to promote death as a release. Richard Allestree, for example, reminds readers that the friends they mourn for are no longer “confined to this prison of the body, but gone to dwell in the region of spirits; they are no longer exposed to these stormy seas, but are gladly arrived at their safe harbor” <bibl>(<title rend="italic">The Whole Duty of Mourning and the Great Concern of Preparing Ourselves for Death</title> [London, 1695], p. 154)</bibl>. Pulter knows this logic, repeats it often in her poetry, and struggles to reconcile it with her attachment to lost persons and, here, to her own flesh and the memory of its lost youth. If it is the soul that is imprisoned in the body, then it is particularly interesting that the speaker has to work to detach the soul from the body, interrogating the soul as to why it loves and clings to its prison. In the poem, “I” and “me” (lines 23, 26) reside with the decaying flesh and not the soul.</note></seg>?</rdg>

                    <rdg wit="#ae">Now <seg>Erra Pater’s<note type="critical">Popular books of prognostication and almanacs were attributed to Erra Pater, “a Jew, born in Jewry,” throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. These texts were so ubiquitous and popular that the name came to describe the books themselves; an almanac might be called an “erra pater” or, since these predictions were considered unreliable or erring, an “errans pater.” Erra Pater was often described as old, as in the broadside “Erra Pater’s Prophesy or Frost Fair 1683,” or depicted with a lined face (see <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Erra Pater and the Sibyl</ref>). In Beaumont and Fletcher’s popular play <title rend="italic">The Scornful Lady</title> (1616), Elder Loveless describes the aged servant, Abigail, as “Thou with a face as old as Erra Pater, such a prognosticating nose: thou thing that ten years since has left to be a woman, outworn the expectation of a bawd, and thy dry bones can reach at nothing now, but gords or ninepins [dice]” (4.1).</note></seg> or a <seg>sibyl’s <note type="critical">Sibyls were female prophets in ancient Greece and Rome. Although they were mortals, they were often depicted as preternaturally old. According to Ovid’s <title rend="italic">Metamorphoses</title>, Phoebus, trying to gain the Cumaean sibyl’s virginity, offered her extended life, but when she refused him, he did not include lasting youth in the bargain. When the sibyl encounters Aeneas in Ovid’s tale, she is 700 years old and decrepit; she imagines that her body will gradually wither until nothing is left but her prophetic voice (see <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Erra Pater and the Sibyl</ref>). Pulter chooses prophets as her images of the aged face, perhaps linking age and wisdom, but she also chooses prophets whose ability to foresee the future many of her contemporaries held in doubt.</note></seg> face.</rdg>

Yet this striking evocation of her body as a source of pleasure is unusual in the poetry. The description of her breasts does not specify for whom they served as the bed of love. Pulter may refer to a husband or lover; Pulter’s husband Arthur is almost invisible in these poems, especially compared to her children. She might also remember nursing her children here.</note></seg>,</rdg>
