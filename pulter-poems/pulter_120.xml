            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

            <note type="editorialnote">Because “Somnus Why Art Thou Still To Me Unkind” is unfinished and contains revisions, likely in Pulter’s hand, I have opted to include scored out and corrected words. To make the poem accessible for all readers, I have modernized the text by updating spelling, expanding contractions, and standardizing capitalization. The only exceptions are cases where the form or the sense of the poem would be lost by modernizing, particularly the elision of syllables to preserve meter. I have also supplied punctuation because, as was typical for seventeenth-century poetry manuscripts, Pulter’s poems contained almost no punctuation. There are both benefits and liabilities to this approach. While the introduction of punctuation improves the sense of grammatical structures for modern readers, it loses the productive ambiguities of the manuscript, where clauses might connect to each other in multiple ways. So I would invite readers to proceed by comparing the edition to the images of the manuscript and the transcription supplied by <hi rend="italic">The Pulter Project</hi>. Does an alternative to my punctuation open up different interpretive possibilities? How might the meaning of the poem change without it? </note>

              <note type="headnote">This fragment of a poem, in what is probably Pulter’s hand, appears on a loose sheet in a folder associated with the bound volume in which her other poems are found. Although a complete copy might someday be found, Pulter appears not to have finished this experimental dream vision about a relatively recent event: the 1667 battle, known as the Raid on the Medway, which ended in the destruction by the Dutch navy of the fort and shipyard at Sheerness, on England’s east coast. Part of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, this was one of the worst defeats ever suffered by the British navy, which saw many warships destroyed or captured and the hasty arrangement by Charles II of an unfavorable treaty. The few extant verses of what promises an epic treatment of these events are framed by the speaker’s recurrent nightmare visions which mingle her distress with an incongruous perception of Sheerness remaining “unconquered” despite the “purple gore” that sprinkles the sea. The speaker’s horrified amazement joins that of the powerful and resplendent water gods and goddesses, mustering (too late, it must be said) as British reinforcements under Saturn’s command. Neptune, Triton, Nereus, Doris: the speaker, perched on a rock above the fray, witnesses a catalogue of mythic powerhouses whom she has imaginatively installed into current political events. What dreamy counterfactual scenario might have ensued, if the poem continued past its opening catalogue and into the martial action one might expect to follow? We will only know if the poem’s continuation one day comes to light.</note>

            <note type="headnote"><p>Written on a loose sheet of paper, probably in Pulter’s own hand, these 41 lines recast recent politics as classical mythology.<seg>1<note type="gloss">On Hester Pulter’s hand, see <bibl>Alice Eardley’s conclusion in <title rend="italic">Hester Pulter, Poems, Emblems, and The Unfortunate Florinda</title>, ed. Alice Eardley, The Other Voice in Early Modern Europe (Iter Gateway to the Middle Ages and Renaissance, 2014), 182</bibl>, note 838.</note></seg> Possibly an unfinished narrative or epic, the poem refers to a battle in the second Anglo-Dutch war that took place in 1667 in the town of Sheerness, on the Isle of Stepney in Kent. Dutch forces captured the town, destroying fortifications, then sailed up the river Medway and part way up the Thames estuary to burn several British ships. The embarrassing defeat for the British is depicted somewhat ambiguously in “Somnus Why Art Thou Still to Me Unkind.” Narrated by an insomniac, the poem recounts a scene in which the sleepless speaker perches on a rock above Sheerness, where she witnesses the tears of the inconsolable Thames. Even though the town has been the site of one notable loss in battle, it remains “unconquered” in the war. “Unconquered Sheere” may mean something like “brave” or “valiant” Sheerness, whatever losses the town has suffered, or it may be one of the rough patches that would have been revised if this work had been completed.</p>
              <p>While “Somnus Why Art Thou Still to Me Unkind” remains unfinished, the opening recalls Pulter’s tactics elsewhere. Like <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="35">The Pismire</ref> and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="45">This Was Written in 1648, When I Lay in, With my Son John</ref>, this poem begins with a personal distress that first manifests as bodily suffering, then goes on to liberate the speaker’s mind to wander freely in contemplation of the scene that confronts her. “Somnus” provides two seemingly related ways to understand the experience of the watchful insomniac: first, through contemporary political turmoil, and, second, through the mythological motifs that might ultimately transform or lend a cosmic significance to the British defeat. The powers of classical deities are relocated to the English coast as the “trembling bosom” of the sea summons the nautical forces of mythology: sea gods, goddesses, minor nymphs, and even helpful dolphins answer the trumpet call and begin to flow toward Sheerness. Neptune “gazes” upon the same “bloody billows” as the speaker, and we are left to suspect that it is partly her own distress that conjures this epic force.</p>
              <p>We can’t know whether Pulter is marshaling the gods to mount a counterattack against the Dutch or to join a mourning procession, but the existing portion of “Somnus Why Art Thou Still to Me Unkind” suggests that she may have been exploring a reading based on Edmund Spenser’s <title rend="italic">The Faerie Queene</title>. Early in Book 3, Britomart sits on a rocky shore, watching “a while the surges hore, / That gainst the craggy clifts did loudly rore.”<seg>2<note type="gloss"><bibl>Edmund Spenser, <title rend="italic">The Faerie Queene</title>, ed. A. C. Hamilton, Toshiyuki Suzuki, and Hiroshi Yamashita, 2nd edition, Longman Annotated Poets (New York: Routledge, 2007), 3.4.7.5-6.</bibl></note></seg> An emblem of chastity, Britomart externalizes her erotic suffering in an extended complaint about the “Huge sea of sorrow, and tempestuous griefe,” and it is possible that this scene of reading the seascape offered Pulter an allegorical text through which she could write her own political distress (3.4.8.1). The geography specific to the Sheerness battle also appears at the end of Book 4 of <title rend="italic">The Faerie Queene</title>, when the narrative thread begun in Britomart’s reading of the sea is brought to a partial resolution by the marriage of the Medway and Thames rivers. Spenser depicts a host of sea gods flowing in to celebrate:</p>

                    <l>Betwixt the Medway and the Thames agreed. (4.11.8.1-4)</l>

              </cit>
              <p>What follows is an epic catalog of the aquatic deities who travel across the globe, from “great Neptune with his threeforkt mace, / That rules the Seas, and makes them rise or fall” to the lesser local nymphs and even the mighty rivers of the Nile and the Amazon (4.11.11.1-2). Like Pulter’s unfinished poem, Spenser’s celebration of England’s fertile estuary overflows its boundaries and remains open-ended. Book 4, Canto 12 of <title rend="italic">The Faerie Queene</title> opens with Spenser responding to the aquatic marriage festivities with a lament for the futility of his own poetic labor: “O what an endlesse worke haue I in hand, / To count the seas abundant progeny” (4.12.1.1-2).</p>
              <p>Whether Pulter was equally stymied by the scope of her task is impossible to say, because “Somnus Why Art Thou Still to Me Unkind” is interrupted well before we learn what the gods had planned at the site of Sheerness’s carnage. This truncated scene invites us to place Pulter’s poetic fragment alongside the work of poets including Spenser and Chaucer whose ambitious plans never achieved fruition. While this Amplified Edition attends to the unfinished state of the poem by preserving revisions that offer evidence of Pulter’s writing practice, it resists offering speculations or conclusions about where those revisions might be heading. In this sense, the trailing off of “Somnus Why Art Thou Still to Me Unkind” functions, as Catherine Nicholson observes of Spenser’s unfinished <title rend="italic">Two Cantos of Mutabilitie</title>, “almost as a gloss on the strange unraveling of the work to which they belong.”<seg>3<note type="gloss"><bibl>Catherine Nicholson, <title rend="italic">Reading and Not Reading The Faerie Queene: Spenser and The Making of Literary Criticism</title> (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2020), 244.</bibl></note></seg></p>
              <p>My edition of the poem attempts to record what remains on the page in order to give a sense of one moment in an active process of poetic composition. In words that were scored out and replaced, we can watch Pulter experiment with word choice and verb tense as she transformed this contemporary episode in international politics into an allegorical and classicizing dream narrative. She twice included marginal markers signaling the entrance of named sea deities, as she does with flowers in her <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="12">The Garden, or The Contention of Flowers</ref>. The final lines of the fragment are rougher, making the relation between clauses particularly mobile, and it is difficult to determine definitively how to punctuate the passages about Doris and her rich jewels. Perhaps the best way to end this edition is with a question: in this unfinished poem, should the last line be closed with a full stop—a final period—or should it remain without any punctuation as a sign of the instant in which Pulter lifted her pen and left her work open for us to receive?</p></note>
