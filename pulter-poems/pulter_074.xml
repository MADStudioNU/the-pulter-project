            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

            <note type="editorialnote">Our priority in editing these poems has been to modernise, and to achieve interpretative and visual clarity, in order to make the poems as accessible as possible to as wide a modern audience as is possible. Spelling is modernised, as is punctuation. Modernising the latter, in particular, often involves a significant act of editorial interpretation, but in our view this is one of the most productive areas of editorial intervention, particularly for a manuscript text such as Pulter’s where the punctuation is erratic compared to modern usage (and, indeed, compared to early modern printed texts). <seg>1<note>1.

              <note type="headnote">Why do people obstinately cling to bad ways, even when facing death? In this emblem, Pulter assumes the persona of the wise counsellor who warns young people about the follies and vanities that can lead a person to damnation. She stacks example upon example of how animals and humans stubbornly refuse to give up immoral behaviors: from the “simple creature” of the title who revels in the earth and oceans, to mythical minute dragons who can exist only in burning fire, to misers who sink their investments in money. The speaker reserves the bulk of her reprimand for the frivolous gallants and ladies of her age who like to gamble, drink, indulge in fashions, and have sex. Calling these folks “ranters” connects the general riotous and noisy partiers to religious radicals in mid-seventeenth-century England who rejected religious authority. What seems to irritate the speaker is their complete immersion in their chosen worlds: as if earthbound pleasures have become the air they breathe. Being removed from sin and entertainment leaves these impassioned fools without the divine life support they need, much like a blubbering turtle gasping for breath or a fish washed ashore.</note>
          </rdg>
          <rdg wit="#ae">
              <note type="headnote"><p>In this emblem, Pulter turns her attention to earthly pleasures and the immorality of indulgence in them. She begins with the turtle as an emblem, describing the enjoyment the creature takes in running and swimming on the earth, which illustrates her “ignoble” nature. The turtle dislikes being inverted “to the skies”, which Pulter construes as an unwillingness to face God (line 5). She proceeds to highlight instances of such unwillingness in the human world, criticising the “gallants”, “wanton[s]”, and “ranters” who choose to overindulge in base, earthly things like money, drink, and unchaste love rather than devote themselves to God (lines 12, 16, 20). For related emblems, see <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="84">The Elephant (Emblem 19)</ref> and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="85">This Poor Turtle Dove (Emblem 20)</ref>, which use similar language to criticise overindulgence and folly. Pulter exposes these people who disobey God’s wishes, criticising intemperate behaviour for its ungratefulness.</p>
                  <p>Key to unveiling this message is a subtle but striking use of form. While the emblem is, for the most part, in Pulter’s typical rhyming couplets, she uses two tercets at lines 5–7 and 24–6 to encapsulate her message: that “wantons”, like the turtle, indulge excessively in the pleasures of the world. These two tercets not only summarise the fate of the turtle and “rant[ing]” humans respectively, but link them together, as Pulter interrupts the overall rhyme scheme of the poem in each case. The repetition of the words “lie” and “die” across the two tercets further affirms the connection and emphasises the moral Pulter wishes to impart: that the pleasures of the world are vain, and those who overindulge in worldly things die in despair.</p>
                  <p>Notably, the emblem’s moral message acquires political connotations: both Eardley and Christian point out that “ranter” was a derogatory term given to religious and political radicals, including those in the Antinomian sect arising in England around the time Pulter was composing her emblem collection (A<bibl>lice Eardley, “An Edition of Lady Hester Pulter’s Book of ‘Emblemes’.” PhD diss. [University of Warwick, 2008], 29 n. 20</bibl>; and <bibl>Stefan Christian, “The Poems of Lady Hester Pulter (1605?–1678): An Annotated Edition.” PhD diss. [University of Massachusetts Amherst, 2012], 289</bibl>). As she does in many of her emblems, Pulter embeds her criticism of the social and political upheaval caused by the republican government in the wider religious instruction directed at her readers. The images of these indulgent ranters, gallants, and wantons remind us that in giving way to impulsive desires, we forget God and the service we owe Him while on earth. Using the two tercets to emphasise these consequences, she then begins her explicit address in the final four lines of the poem, as she implores: “hear a friend that tells you but the truth”, indicating the authorial role she possesses as she mediates the devotional message of servitude to God (line 32). Drawing on Ecclesiastes 12.1, Pulter urges her readers to “Remember thy creator in thy youth”, instructing against the careless indulgences she presents earlier and warning that otherwise “Hell will have its due” (lines 28, 30). Instead, she offers her expostulation: be God’s humble and devoted servant on earth and be safe from the earthly distractions which incur judgement.</p>
