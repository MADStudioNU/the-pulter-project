            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

              <note type="editorialnote">In my editions of Pulter’s poems, I aim for my annotations to prompt further exploration. To make the poems accessible to the widest possible audience, I have modernized spelling, punctuation, and capitalization according to American English standards. My longer critical notes demonstrate the complexity of Pulter’s thinking, while opening space for the reader’s own analysis and interpretation. In that same vein, I briefly note Pulter’s revisions to the poems in order to foreground her poetic craft. Her manuscript features variants and revisions that invite multiple interpretations, and I encourage readers to refer to the manuscript transcriptions and images as they engage with Pulter’s writing. I offer some intertextual references to other early modern texts, but am most interested in drawing out how Pulter’s poems speak to each other as she reflects on clusters of ideas.</note>

              <note type="headnote"> Damned if you do, damned if you don’t—this emblem asks the reader to imagine three seemingly unrelated creatures who must choose between equally hazardous options: the flying fish who faces predators whether leaping in the sky or diving beneath the waters; a wounded deer who can flee and bleed to death, or get caught when resting to conserve energy; and Charles I, who surrendered during the civil war to those in his native Scotland (who betrayed him) in order to evade English armies. Envisioning the king as akin to a quivering and bleeding deer connects him imagistically with Pulter’s dying daughter, Jane, in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="10">Upon the Death of my Dear and Lovely Daughter</ref>, thus showing the crossover between Pulter’s vocabularies for expressing political and personal elegy. Yet what at first seems a lesson in futility turns, in this emblem’s final four lines, to a discovery of consolation, since Charles’ death offers a paradoxical triumph: martyrdom allows for fame and duration beyond the individual life. Pulter concludes not by drawing out the implications of the Christian paradox of dying to live, but by schooling her readers to put their tribulations into a larger perspective: after all, life could always be worse, as her three examples demonstrate—and even that “worse” might be, unexpectedly, conjoined with the very best.</note>

          <rdg wit="#ae">
              <note type="headnote"><p>Emblem 25 is a Royalist polemic – a strong written argument against a group of people – but we don’t know it until the poem’s concluding lines. Like many of Pulter’s emblems, the poem begins by drawing the reader’s attention to specific situations in the natural world. This Royalist emblem poem meditates on two creatures. First, a “flying fish” fights for her life, diving in and out of the sea as she tries to avoid predators in both the air and water. Pulter’s second example is a wounded “hart” (a red deer), “oppressed” by hunting dogs and vulnerable to human predators. Finally, in line 15, the poem’s political objectives come into focus as Pulter turns to her main subject: the betrayal of Charles I by the Scottish army in 1647, a key event in the English Civil Wars (1642–1651).</p>
                  <p>Before turning to the highly charged language of the poem’s closing lines, it is useful to consider <hi rend="italic">how</hi> Pulter frames her political argument. Importantly, this is a poem, not a formal political tract or pamphlet – the kind of short, cheap vernacular work usually printed in quarto that intervened explicitly in ongoing public and political debate. The pamphlet in particular was an important political tool during the English Civil Wars, and both Royalists and Parliamentarians wielded the genre to cultivate public sympathy. While pamphleteers employed a range of rhetorical and literary figures to persuade, their arguments tended to be straightforward and plainly stated.<seg>1<note type="gloss">For more on the pamphlet genre and its political and social contexts during the Civil Wars, see <bibl>Joad Raymond, <title>Pamphlets and Pamphleteering in Early Modern Britain</title> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), especially Chapters 5-8</bibl>.</note></seg> In contrast, Pulter’s poem relies on literary form to do its political work.</p>
                  <p>The poem unfolds as an accumulation of examples, not unlike <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="10">Upon the Death of My Dear and Lovely Daughter, Jane Pulter</ref>, which employs some of the same imagery to emphasize Jane’s vulnerability. Here in Emblem 25, Pulter introduces her linked examples with the echoing chorus “so have I seen” (line 11) and “so have I known” (line 15). She coaxes her readers along with examples that, at first, seem distant from human events, but gradually give way to a vehement political stance. Her creaturely examples rely on the striking visual language we find across her emblem poems: her “flying fish” has “shining wings,” and she “springs” and “dives” in the “swelling” and “frothy” sea (lines 1-6). Pulter’s alliteration draws our attention to the creature’s vulnerability. Her “helpless, harmless” fish is pursued by “hungry hawks” and “whales” that “watch” (lines 7-8). She also manipulates gender pronouns throughout the poem in service of her political argument. Both flying fish and wounded hart are given female pronouns (she/her), even though the term “hart” was most commonly used to refer to the male stag red deer. When Pulter then uses male pronouns (he/him) to refer to Charles I, the female pronouns haunt the second half of the poem. Pulter counts Charles among the “helpless,” “harmless,” “guitless” female creatures of the poem’s first half, amplifying his vulnerability within the context of this poem (“everywhere enclosed” by his “foes”).</p>
                  <p>In the poem’s closing lines, Pulter references an event that occurred toward the end of the Civil Wars, just a few years before Charles’s eventual execution. Charles sought refuge with the Scottish army in May 1646 but, as Alice Eardley recounts in her note on this poem, the Scots negotiated with the English Parliament and turned Charles over to them in January 1647.<seg>2<note type="gloss"><bibl>Alice Eardley, ed. “Emblem 25,” <title rend="italic">Poems, Emblems, and The Unfortunate Florinda</title> (Toronto: Iter Inc., 2014), 220 n.212</bibl>.</note></seg> Pulter accuses the Scottish people of the ultimate betrayal by comparing their action against Charles I to Judas Iscariot’s betrayal of Jesus Christ (a significant comparison for a devout Christian poet). Directly addressing a “base” and “perfidious Scot” (line 21), Pulter lays the blame for Charles’s death on the Scottish people, while also compressing (or neglecting) part of the story. Charles I subsequently signed an agreement with the Royalist Scots, who invaded England on his behalf. The fighting continued through 1648 (the period often referred to as the “Second Civil War”) before Charles was finally executed by order of the English Parliament in January 1649. Pulter’s anger against the unnamed “Scot” in the poem’s second half manifests as a subtle form of bigotry – acrimonious and divisive rhetoric also on display in some of her other political poems, such as <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="62">On the Fall of that Grand Rebel</ref> and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="115">Phalaris and the Brazen Bull</ref>.</p>
                  <p>On the one hand, the poetic political emblem is an especially keen rhetorical move, fitting for the extraordinarily divisive period of the English Civil Wars. Is Pulter perhaps offering her own version of “how to talk to your family about politics during the holidays” (see, for instance, Jamilah King’s November 2019 article in <ref target="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/11/ibram-kendi-antiracist-talk-to-racist-family-friends-holidays/" type="new-window-url">Mother Jones</ref>)? On the other hand, we have to think critically about Pulter’s rhetorical prowess in this poem. Does her argument land? Pulter’s accumulated examples work to garner sympathy for the Royalist cause, ultimately drawing on the widespread comparison of Charles I to Christ that found its most affecting expression in the <title rend="italic">Eikōn Basilikē</title> (1649), a spiritual biography attributed to Charles himself. Each of her examples describes violent action against vulnerable creatures, and Charles Stuart is portrayed as the most vulnerable of all (“the thought of this such horror brings / to my sad soul” [line 16-17]). Her sharp polemical tone in the poem’s final lines, however, might give us pause. Does our reading of this emblem ultimately result in a sympathetic stance toward Charles’s plight?</p></note>

Both are used to express an emotion that, because of the parenthesis, seems both part of and apart from the poet’s representation of Charles’s death. The parenthesis, as Jonathan P. Lamb notes, is both a “textual and rhetorical marker.” These punctuation marks create a “structure of intimate exchange between ourselves and the narrative voice,” one that seems somehow more private than the text around it (see <bibl>Lamb, “Parentheses and Privacy in Philip Sidney’s Arcadia,” <title rend="italic">Studies in Philology</title> 107.3 [2010]: 311</bibl>).

            <rdg wit="#ae"><seg>Perfidious Scot<note type="gloss">In this line, Pulter uses highly inflammatory language against the Scottish people, directly addressing a “perfidious Scot” (“faithless” or “treacherous”) who, because of the lack of defining article in the poem (“a” or “the”) becomes representative of all Scots. Pulter’s charged political language constructs an antagonistic <hi rend="italic">us vs. them</hi> relationship. When she refers to the Scot’s actions as “base” (“thou this base plot didst lay”), Pulter compounds her acerbic address through the multiple connotations of “base,” which implies “low” in social rank, in quality or value, and in morality. For foundational work on women writers and their roles in policing and constructing national and racial hierarchies in early modern England, see <bibl>Margo Hendricks and Patricia Parker’s edited volume, <title rend="italic">Women, “Race,” and Writing in the Early Modern Period</title> (Routledge, 1994)</bibl>.</note></seg>, thou <seg>this base plot<note type="gloss"> After a series of defeats for the royalists in 1645, Charles sought refuge with a Scottish army.

            <rdg wit="#ae">Iscariot-like thou didst thy <seg>kings<note type="gloss">Pulter’s use of the plural “kings,” as Leah Knight and Wendy Wall point out in the Elemental Edition of this poem, connects Charles I directly with Christ, betrayed by the Scots as Christ was betrayed by Judas Iscariot. The comparison between Charles and Christ, particularly after Charles’s execution, was an important Royalist rhetorical tool. The comparison was largely seeded in Charles’s own publication just before his death, the <title rend="italic">Eikōn Basilikē</title> (1649), complete with a foldout frontispiece portraying a kneeling Charles clutching a crown of thorns. In this “personal confession of conscience written in the style of spiritual autobiography and Protestant martyrology,” Charles offers his subjects access to his private thoughts and prayers (<bibl>Stephanie E. Koscak, <title rend="italic">Monarchy, Print Culture, and Reverence in Early Modern England: Picturing Royal Subjects</title> [New York: Routledge, 2020], 36</bibl>). In one meditation on his forthcoming execution, Charles declares that his death will redeem “my sins and the sins of my people,” before echoing Christ’s words at the crucifixion: “forgive them! O my Father, for they know not what they do” (<bibl><title rend="italic">Eikōn Basilikē: The Pourtraicture of His Sacred Majestie in His Solitudes and Sufferings</title> [London: Richard Royston, 1649], 49</bibl>). Pulter drew on this comparison often. In <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="15">Let None Sigh No More for Lucas or for Lisle</ref>, for instance, Pulter’s analogy between Charles and Christ also fuels a prejudicial outburst (lines 9-11), as we see in this poem’s lines 21-22. For a particularly clever comparison between Charles and other famous kingly figures, see <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="116">British Brennus (Emblem 51)</ref>, where Pulter plays on the letter “C” as she draws connections between Charles I, Charles II, and Christ. </note></seg> betray.</rdg>

<!--            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>-->

<!--              <note type="editorialnote">In my editions of Pulter’s poems, I aim for my annotations to prompt further exploration. To make the poems accessible to the widest possible audience, I have modernized spelling, punctuation, and capitalization according to American English standards. My longer critical notes demonstrate the complexity of Pulter’s thinking, while opening space for the reader’s own analysis and interpretation. In that same vein, I briefly note Pulter’s revisions to the poems in order to foreground her poetic craft. Her manuscript features variants and revisions that invite multiple interpretations, and I encourage readers to refer to the manuscript transcriptions and images as they engage with Pulter’s writing. I offer some intertextual references to other early modern texts, but am most interested in drawing out how Pulter’s poems speak to each other as she reflects on clusters of ideas.</note>-->

<!--              <note type="headnote"> Damned if you do, damned if you don’t—this emblem asks the reader to imagine three seemingly unrelated creatures who must choose between equally hazardous options: the flying fish who faces predators whether leaping in the sky or diving beneath the waters; a wounded deer who can flee and bleed to death, or get caught when resting to conserve energy; and Charles I, who surrendered during the civil war to those in his native Scotland (who betrayed him) in order to evade English armies. Envisioning the king as akin to a quivering and bleeding deer connects him imagistically with Pulter’s dying daughter, Jane, in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="10">Upon the Death of my Dear and Lovely Daughter</ref>, thus showing the crossover between Pulter’s vocabularies for expressing political and personal elegy. Yet what at first seems a lesson in futility turns, in this emblem’s final four lines, to a discovery of consolation, since Charles’ death offers a paradoxical triumph: martyrdom allows for fame and duration beyond the individual life. Pulter concludes not by drawing out the implications of the Christian paradox of dying to live, but by schooling her readers to put their tribulations into a larger perspective: after all, life could always be worse, as her three examples demonstrate—and even that “worse” might be, unexpectedly, conjoined with the very best.</note>-->

<!--              <note type="headnote"><p>Emblem 25 is a Royalist polemic—a strong written argument against a group of people – but we don’t know it until the poem’s concluding lines. Like many of Pulter’s emblems, the poem begins by drawing the reader’s attention to specific situations in the natural world. This Royalist emblem poem meditates on two creatures. First, a “flying fish” fights for her life, diving in and out of the sea as she tries to avoid predators in both the air and water. Pulter’s second example is a wounded “hart” (a red deer), “oppressed” by hunting dogs and vulnerable to human predators. Finally, in line 15, the poem’s political objectives come into focus as Pulter turns to her main subject: the betrayal of Charles I by the Scottish army in 1647, a key event in the English Civil Wars (1642-1651).</p>-->
<!--                  <p>Before turning to the highly charged language of the poem’s closing lines, it is useful to consider <hi rend="italic">how</hi> Pulter frames her political argument. Importantly, this is a poem, not a formal political tract or pamphlet—the kind of short, cheap vernacular work usually printed in quarto that intervened explicitly in ongoing public and political debate. The pamphlet in particular was an important political tool during the English Civil Wars, and both Royalists and Parliamentarians wielded the genre to cultivate public sympathy. While pamphleteers employed a range of rhetorical and literary figures to persuade, their arguments tended to be straightforward and plainly stated.<seg>1<note type="gloss">For more on the pamphlet genre and its political and social contexts during the Civil Wars, see <bibl>Joad Raymond, <title>Pamphlets and Pamphleteering in Early Modern Britain</title> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), especially Chapters 5-8</bibl>.</note></seg> In contrast, Pulter’s poem relies on literary form to do its political work.</p>-->
<!--                  <p>The poem unfolds as an accumulation of examples, not unlike <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="10">Upon the Death of My Dear and Lovely Daughter, Jane Pulter</ref>, which employs some of the same imagery to emphasize Jane’s vulnerability. Here in Emblem 25, Pulter introduces her linked examples with the echoing chorus “so have I seen” (line 11) and “so have I known” (line 15). She coaxes her readers along with examples that, at first, seem distant from human events, but gradually give way to a vehement political stance. Her creaturely examples rely on the striking visual language we find across her emblem poems: her “flying fish” has “shining wings,” and she “springs” and “dives” in the “swelling” and “frothy” sea (lines 1-6). Pulter’s alliteration draws our attention to the creature’s vulnerability. Her “helpless, harmless” fish is pursued by “hungry hawks” and “whales” that “watch” (lines 7-8). She also manipulates gender pronouns throughout the poem in service of her political argument. Both flying fish and wounded hart are given female pronouns (she/her), even though the term “hart” was most commonly used to refer to the male stag red deer. When Pulter then uses male pronouns (he/him) to refer to Charles I, the female pronouns haunt the second half of the poem. Pulter counts Charles among the “helpless,” “harmless,” “guitless” female creatures of the poem’s first half, amplifying his vulnerability within the context of this poem (“everywhere enclosed” by his “foes”).</p>-->
<!--                  <p>In the poem’s closing lines, Pulter references an event that occurred toward the end of the Civil Wars, just a few years before Charles’s eventual execution. Charles sought refuge with the Scottish army in May 1646 but, as Alice Eardley recounts in her note on this poem, the Scots negotiated with the English Parliament and turned Charles over to them in January 1647.<seg>2<note type="gloss"><bibl>Alice Eardley, ed. “Emblem 25,” <title rend="italic">Poems, Emblems, and The Unfortunate Florinda</title> (Toronto: Iter Inc., 2014), 220 n.212</bibl>.</note></seg> Pulter accuses the Scottish people of the ultimate betrayal by comparing their action against Charles I to Judas Iscariot’s betrayal of Jesus Christ (a significant comparison for a devout Christian poet). Directly addressing a “base” and “perfidious Scot” (line 21), Pulter lays the blame for Charles’s death on the Scottish people, while also compressing (or neglecting) part of the story. Charles I subsequently signed an agreement with the Royalist Scots, who invaded England on his behalf. The fighting continued through 1648 (the period often referred to as the “Second Civil War”) before Charles was finally executed by order of the English Parliament in January 1649. Pulter’s anger against the unnamed “Scot” in the poem’s second half manifests as a subtle form of bigotry – acrimonious and divisive rhetoric also on display in some of her other political poems, such as <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="62">On the Fall of that Grand Rebel</ref> and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="115">Phalaris and the Brazen Bull</ref>.</p>-->
<!--                  <p>On the one hand, the poetic political emblem is an especially keen rhetorical move, fitting for the extraordinarily divisive period of the English Civil Wars. Is Pulter perhaps offering her own version of “how to talk to your family about politics during the holidays” (see, for instance, Jamilah King’s November 2019 article in <ref target="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/11/ibram-kendi-antiracist-talk-to-racist-family-friends-holidays/" type="new-window-url">Mother Jones</ref>)? On the other hand, we have to think critically about Pulter’s rhetorical prowess in this poem. Does her argument land? Pulter’s accumulated examples work to garner sympathy for the Royalist cause, ultimately drawing on the widespread comparison of Charles I to Christ that found its most affecting expression in the <title rend="italic">Eikōn Basilikē</title> (1649), a spiritual biography attributed to Charles himself. Each of her examples describes violent action against vulnerable creatures, and Charles Stuart is portrayed as the most vulnerable of all (“the thought of this such horror brings / to my sad soul” [line 16-17]). Her sharp polemical tone in the poem’s final lines, however, might give us pause. Does our reading of this emblem ultimately result in a sympathetic stance toward Charles’s plight?</p></note>-->

The comparison between Charles and Christ, particularly after Charles’s execution, was an important Royalist rhetorical tool. The comparison was largely seeded in Charles’s own publication just before his death, the <title rend="italic">Eikōn Basilikē</title> (1649), complete with a foldout frontispiece portraying a kneeling Charles clutching a crown of thorns. In this “personal confession of conscience written in the style of spiritual autobiography and Protestant martyrology,” Charles offers his subjects access to his private thoughts and prayers (<bibl>Stephanie E. Koscak, <title rend="italic">Monarchy, Print Culture, and Reverence in Early Modern England: Picturing Royal Subjects</title> [New York: Routledge, 2020], 36</bibl>). In one meditation on his forthcoming execution, Charles declares that his death will redeem “my sins and the sins of my people,” before echoing Christ’s words at the crucifixion: “forgive them! O my Father, for they know not what they do” (<bibl><title rend="italic">Eikōn Basilikē: The Pourtraicture of His Sacred Majestie in His Solitudes and Sufferings</title> [London: Richard Royston, 1649], 49</bibl>). Pulter drew on this comparison often. In <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="15">Let None Sigh No More for Lucas or for Lisle</ref>, for instance, Pulter’s analogy between Charles and Christ also fuels a prejudicial outburst (lines 9-11), as we see in this poem’s lines 21-22. For a particularly clever comparison between Charles and other famous kingly figures, see <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="116">British Brennus (Emblem 51)</ref>, where Pulter plays on the letter “C” as she draws connections between Charles I, Charles II, and Christ. </note></seg> betray.</rdg>-->

Parliament’s case was that Charles had consistently governed against the people’s best interests, outlined in the opening of their “Charge Against the King” (1648): “by his trust, oath, and office, being obliged to use the power committed to him for the good and benefit of the people, and for the preservation of their rights and liberties; yet, nevertheless, out of a wicked design to erect and uphold in himself an unlimited and tyrannical power to rule according to his will, and to overthrow the rights and liberties of the people … he, the said Charles Stuart...hath traitorously and maliciously levied war against the present Parliament, and the people therein represented” (<bibl>“The Charge Against the King,” January 1648, document reproduced in <title rend="italic">The Constitutional Documents of the Puritan Revolution</title>, Ed. Samuel Rawson Gardiner, Oxford, 1906, pages 371-72</bibl>).</note></seg> but got a lasting fame.</rdg>-->
