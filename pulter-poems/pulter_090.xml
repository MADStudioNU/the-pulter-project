          <p>Apparent errors are preserved and editorial corrections provided using SIC and CORR tags, but only where the editor conjectures that the original scribe or compositor would have recognized the instance as an error. For example, what according to modern usage is incorrect subject/verb agreement might have been deemed acceptable to a seventeenth-century scribe or compositor. All such instances are treated instead using the ORIG and REG tags. (See below.)</p>
          <p>Corrections and annotations made within the scope of the original document either by its original authors, owners, and/or transcribers are noted using ADD tags. These annotations and may be further explained within NOTE tags, as added by the editors of this digital edition, for display within the apparatus.</p>

        <normalization>
          <p>Original spellings, abbreviations, and orthography are preserved.

            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

          <rdg wit="#ee">
            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

              <note type="headnote"> Damned if you do, damned if you don’t—this emblem asks the reader to imagine three seemingly unrelated creatures who must choose between equally hazardous options: the flying fish who faces predators whether leaping in the sky or diving beneath the waters; a wounded deer who can flee and bleed to death, or get caught when resting to conserve energy; and Charles I, who surrendered during the civil war to those in his native Scotland (who betrayed him) in order to evade English armies. Envisioning the king as akin to a quivering and bleeding deer connects him imagistically with Pulter’s dying daughter, Jane, in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="10">Upon the Death of my Dear and Lovely Daughter</ref>, thus showing the crossover between Pulter’s vocabularies for expressing political and personal elegy. Yet what at first seems a lesson in futility turns, in this emblem’s final four lines, to a discovery of consolation, since Charles’ death offers a paradoxical triumph: martyrdom allows for fame and duration beyond the individual life. Pulter concludes not by drawing out the implications of the Christian paradox of dying to live, but by schooling her readers to put their tribulations into a larger perspective: after all, life could always be worse, as her three examples demonstrate—and even that “worse” might be, unexpectedly, conjoined with the very best.</note>
