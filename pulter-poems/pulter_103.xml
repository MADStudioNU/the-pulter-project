            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

              <note type="editorialnote">This is a semi-diplomatic transcription in which original spelling and punctuation are retained, abbreviations (such as tildes) are expanded with added letters in italics (with the exception of “y<add place="above">e</add>” which is rendered as “the”), superscriptions are lowered, colons indicating abbreviations are removed, and “ff” is modernized to “F.” The retention of original spelling and punctuation has the potential to get us closer to the choices made by the poet and scribe, but some scribal details (such as abbreviations) do not seem substantive or meaning-bearing and run the risk of alienating a modern reader.</note>

              <note type="headnote">In a beast fable critiquing obsequious quacks and self-indulgent, blood-sucking tyrants, Pulter’s vibrant sense of humor and talent for a good yarn are on display. The charlatan Dr. Fox is happy to tell his patient what he wants to hear, as long as he gets paid; the craven lion—not noble, here, but despotic—is easily manipulated into devouring his own subjects (derided as apes). Pulter draws a biting moral: “To an old tyrant … / No music pleaseth but the dying groan / Of innocents.” The pause after that last half-line only emphasizes the terrifying speed of what follows, logically and chronologically—“Then straight the apes were killed”—while the next (similarly bisected) line shows the upshot of such a reign of terror: the lion’s eased, the doctor paid. So—what <hi rend="italic">is </hi> the moral here? Bad and worse rewarded, innocents eaten: in the end, all Pulter can hope is to evade such examples of the worst of our kind. Perhaps one consolation of her confinement to a country estate (which she elsewhere laments) was her reduced likelihood of her encountering and being killed by such corruption; and perhaps her very distance from centers of power, during and after England’s civil wars, provided a safe space from which to critique such tyranny and sycophancy as she represents here and which she reviled in the fallen politics of her day.</note>

          <rdg wit="#ae">
              <note type="headnote">This emblem depicts an ill lion being cured by a fox who feeds him slaughtered apes. Pulter’s lion is a tyrannical king, and her repeated use of political language in the emblem (subjects, tyrant, highness, court, sovereign, royal) connotes the context of human rulers. She may be alluding to Machiavelli’s controversial advice tract <title rend="italic">The Prince</title>, as well as to the medieval beast fable tradition of the very crafty Reynard the Fox. As with all of Pulter’s emblems no actual picture is supplied, but the vivid depictions of animals and their behaviour clearly fit the genre’s traditional function of teaching a moral lesson (in this case, that of avoiding corrupt rulers and doctors).</note>

            <rdg wit="#ae">And, of his Subjects was <seg>not lov’d but fear’d<note type="critical">While the lion is proverbially the king of the beasts, there may be an additional context of some of the language and imagery from Niccolò Machiavelli’s political treatise <title rend="italic">The Prince</title> (1513, first printed in Italian in 1532, and first printed in English in 1640). Chapter 17 of <title rend="italic">Nicholas Machiavel’s Prince … Translated out of Italian into English; by E.D…</title> (1640) is headed “Of Cruelty, and Clemency, and whether it is better to be belov’d, or feard” (p. 128). The issue is resolved as follows: “I answer, a man would wish hee might bee the one and the other: but because hardly can they subsist both together, it is much safer to be feard, than be lov’d” (p. 130; see <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Machiavelli’s Prince: Better to be Loved or Feared?</ref> in Curations). In line two of this emblem, Pulter notes that this lion was “not lov’d but fear’d.” A second way in which Pulter may be alluding to Machiavelli’s treatise is in her juxtaposition of a lion and a fox. In Chapter 18 of Machiavelli’s treatise (“In what manner Princes ought to keep their words,” p. 135) is the famous advice that a ruler should be both a lion and a fox, in that he should be both powerful and crafty (see <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Machiavelli’s Lion and Fox</ref> in Curations). Though Pulter is not making this precise point in her emblem, the brutality of her lion and the cunning of her fox may recall these archetypes. Machiavelli’s translator, Edward Dacres, acknowledges in his epistle to the reader that some people may disapprove of his decision to translate <title rend="italic">The Prince</title> into English, “For his maximes and tenents are condemnd of all, as pernicious to all Christian States, and hurtfull to all humane Societies” (sig. A4r). Pulter likely shared this common view of Machiavelli’s political theory, as is demonstrated by her firm condemnation of the lion king and his vulpine advisor.</note></seg></rdg>

Sands, Harvard University Press, 1960). One of Reynard’s trickster identities in the tradition is that of a false physician (for some images from a medieval manuscript, see <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Doctor Fox and the Medieval Beast Fable</ref> in Curations). Ben Jonson’s play <title rend="italic">Volpone or The Fox</title> (1607) depicts the main character (whose name translates in Latin and Italian as “fox”) disguising himself as a mountebank in act 2, scenes 2 and 3, to sell fraudulent medicines in the courtyard beneath the beautiful Celia’s window.</note></seg> is Sent for all in hast</rdg>

In his chapter “Of the Ape,” Topsell writes, “A Lyon ruleth the beasts of the earth, and a Dolphin the beasts of the sea, when the Dolphin is in age and sickness, she recouereth by eating a sea-ape: and so the Lyon by eating an ape of the earth, and therefore the Egiptians paint a Lyon eating an ape, to signifie, a sicke man curing himselfe” (p. 5). In his chapter “Of the Lyon,” Topsell notes that “They eate also Apes, but more for Phisicke then for nourishment” (p. 464), and “if hee can meete with an Ape, he deuoureth and eateth his flesh, and this is the principall remedy and medicine, which hee receiueth against all his diseases, both in youth and age, and when he groweth old, being no more able to hunt Harts, Boares, and such beasts, he exerciseth his whole strength in the hunting, and taking of Apes, whereupon he liueth totally” (p. 482). Pulter may have consulted the version of this lore from Pliny (a source she quoted elsewhere, such as in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="89">The Marmottane (Emblem 24)</ref>), since Pliny provides two details that she uses. These are that the apes mock the lion, and that the apes’ blood cures him: “The Lion is neuer sicke but of the peeuishnesse of his stomacke, loathing all meat: and then the way to cure him is to ty vnto him certaine shee Apes, which with their wanton mocking and making mowes [i.e., grimacing derisively] at him, may moue his patience, and driue him for the very indignitie of their malapert saucinesse, into a fit of madnesse; and then so soone as he hath tasted their bloud he is perfectly wel again: and this is the only help” (p. 202; book 8, chapter 16). Pulter has changed the mocking female apes into courtiers (“people ’bout your Court,” line 17), whose powerlessness is stressed by the pun on “Soveraign” (their sovereign, or ruler—the lion—sees their blood as sovereign, or the best cure for his illness, which he accesses by killing them).

The royal eagle is the fifth and is “descended from the gentle and right airie of Ægles. This Ægle roial, is of a middle bignesse and of a reddish colour, a rare bird to be seene” (p. 272). He claims that all eagles “die not for age, nor vpon any sicknesse, but of very famine, by reason that the vpper beake of their bil is so far ouergrown and turns inward so much, that they are not able to open it to feed themselues” (p. 273). He doesn’t specifically mention that eagles suck blood to survive in their old age.</note></seg></rdg>
