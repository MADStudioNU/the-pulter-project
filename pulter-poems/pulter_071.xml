                        The aim of the elemental edition to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers,
                        which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and
                        punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might
                        otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not
                        modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote
                        aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by
                        Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to
                        allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various
                        possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure
                        material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford
                        Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s
                        edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The
                        result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.

                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">Perhaps only a paradisal species can achieve true equality in parenting—or so Pulter suggests here. But specialized anatomical hardware can help: in this emblem, a male bird sports in his back a “pit” for the eggs on which the concave-bellied female sits. Pulter’s manucodiats—better known as birds-of-paradise—are praised for this evidence of their transcendent love, unity, kindness, and “indulgency,” all qualities treated as signs of their divine origin. Rather than a call for more active and loving fathering, though, the speaker’s reflection on these birds becomes a prayer that she might be infused with love for her relations, which might suggest that this avian model of companionate marriage did not match her experience.</note></rdg>
                <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">In this poem, the Manucodiat, a bird now known as a bird-of-paradise, becomes an emblem that allows for an exploration of the links between God’s love for his creations, a parent’s love for her partner and her children, and the speaker’s own desires for spiritual transcendence. The first half of the poem describes the fabulous lore associated with the bird-of-paradise. It was believed that these birds never landed on the ground, fed only upon dew, and hatched their eggs from the conjoined bodies of male and female partners. Pulter explains that these birds are “crowned” for their “indulgency”—of their partners and their offspring—and this quality becomes the basis for the lesson of the second half of the poem. Parents are instructed to learn “indulgency” from the example of the birds-of-paradise, but the speaker develops this general injunction of “unity” into self-reflection and self-interrogation. Love comes only from “above,” and the speaker implores God to “irradiate” her soul with this love so that she may serve as an intermediary between the divine and her relations on earth. The speaker longs to inhabit the liminal space of the birds-of-paradise—halfway between the heavens and the earth—a conclusion that expands their emblematic significance.</note></rdg>

European travelers and natural historians wrote about the bird-of-paradise for the first time in the sixteenth century, though most were familiar with the animal only through dead specimens. The bird-of-paradise was the subject of much lore and legend, which Pulter acknowledges in the first line of the poem (“as authors write”). One important part of this lore is its association with the phoenix, a divine bird that is reborn from its own ashes. Thomas P. Harrison collects much of this lore, including its association with the phoenix, in <bibl>“Bird of Paradise: Phoenix Redivivus,” <hi rend="italic">Isis</hi>, vol. 51, no 2 (1960): pp. 173-80.</bibl></note></seg>,</rdg>

The bird-of-paradise is included with the “Strange admirable birds” on the fifth day of the first week of the poem. The belief that the bird-of-paradise has no feet and, thus, never touches the ground, likely derives from the preparation of specimens with the feet, and sometimes wings and heads, removed (Harrison 175). For an illustration of a speciment prepared this way and an excerpt from Du Bartas’s poem, see “Birds Without Feet?” in the Curations for this poem.</note></seg>.</rdg>

The birds-of-paradise “transcend all animals in love” because of their unique anatomy, as understood by their first European observers, allows the male and female to join together to protect the egg. By the second half of the seventeenth century, natural historians had begun to challenge earlier accounts of this bird. See “Birds Without Feet?” in the Curations for this poem.</note></seg>,</rdg>
