Pulter follows both a poetic and a devotional tradition in meditating upon her spiritual health at a moment of severe illness. Where Donne’s meditations spiral outwards to take in all of humankind as well as (in ‘Hymn to God’) questions of the shape and composition of the world, Pulter’s focus remains primarily personal and intimate, though also exemplary.</note></seg></rdg>

                        The aim of the elemental edition to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers,
                        which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and
                        punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might
                        otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not
                        modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote
                        aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by
                        Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to
                        allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various
                        possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure
                        material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford
                        Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s
                        edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The
                        result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.

I have regularised u/v and i/j, which were interchangeable in the period during which Pulter was writing, and have also regularised ‘ff’ to F. Otherwise, I have generally preserved Pulter’s spelling, and have attempted to represent some of Pulter’s characteristic uses of space (especially her lines and flourishes at the beginnings and ends of poems, which frequently contribute to meaning and interpretation). My annotations focus primarily on understanding the idiosyncratic ideas and densely-packed meanings of Pulter’s poems, though I also draw attention to questions of form, especially where I feel this contributes to or reinforces the complex arguments of Pulter’s verse.</note></rdg>

                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">We tend to think the sick want to recover, but this is not always true. This poem’s title asks us to casts a retrospective gaze on its scene of composition during Pulter’s experience as a patient, when she suffered, it seems, less from her illness than from her reluctance to die. After diagnosing the trouble with her heart and soul, she lambasts the latter for clinging to life despite its tragic and dismal nature. Such shaming turns to a rousing pep-talk as she encourages her soul to speed toward death in order to embrace the glory and grace of the afterlife. The poem seems to have achieved its end of turning the speaker’s thoughts resolutely toward her own end, since it winds up with a valediction to all her earthly goods—barring her friends, whom she anticipates meeting in heaven. With its concluding lines focused on dispersing the speaker’s worldly wealth in the company of loving witnesses (those friends), the poem manages to generate the aura of a deathbed scene; so much is belied, however, by the date in the title, which suggests Pulter still had to endure two more decades of life—decades including yet more illness of her own (referred to in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="45">"This Was Written in 1648, When I Lay in, With my Son John" (Poem 45)</ref> and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="51">"Made When I Was Not Well" (Poem 51)</ref>), the assassination of her beloved monarch (<ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="14">"On the Horrid Murder of that Incomparable Prince" (Poem 14)</ref> and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="15">"Let None Sigh More for Lucas or for Lisle [On the Same [2]]" (Poem 15)</ref>), and the deaths of almost all of her fifteen children: a “sable scene” indeed.</note></rdg>
                <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">This poem fits neatly onto one page, giving a fitting finality to its concluding farewell to the world. Like many of Pulter’s poems it meditates on the frailty of the body, identifying itself as written in a time of illness, in the tradition of Donne’s <title rend="italic">Devotions upon emergent occasions</title>, but also in line with devotional advice provided by preachers and religious treatises, which instructed the good Christian to prepare for death. The poem engages with a tradition of staged poetic debates between body and soul, and with longstanding theological and natural philosophical traditions that meditated on their relationship, and asked questions about the nature and materiality of the soul.</note></rdg>

Sighs and groans were understood to be a fitting accompaniment to heartfelt prayer, as well as expressions of strong, otherwise inexpressible emotion, but they posed a challenge to both writers and printers who wanted to express them on the page. George Herbert frequently reflects on the power of sighs to effect spiritual change: in ‘The Affliction’ he reflects ‘My heart did heave, and there came forth, <hi rend="italic">O God</hi> … / Had thou not had thy part, / Sure the unruly sigh had broke my heart’ <bibl>(<title rend="italics">The Temple</title>, London, 1633, C8v)</bibl>.

                    <rdg wit="#ae">To <seg>rottennes<note>i.e. to the body, here, by metonymy, equated with its ‘rottenness’ (putrefaction). Pulter insists upon the present ‘rottenness’ of the body, even prior to its posthumous decay. In a treatise on the resurrection of bodies, published in 1640, the popular preacher and scholar Richard Sibbes reminded readers: ‘Those that die in much honour and pompe, and have their bodies imbalmed, doe all what they can with the body, it will come to dust and rottennesse; it will be vile in death’ (<bibl><title rend="italic">Evangellical Sacrifices. In xix. Sermons. … The third tome</title>, Ee4v</bibl>). The term has spiritual as well as physical connotations, describing ‘The state or quality of being morally corrupt; depravity; lack of integrity’ (<title rend="italic">OED</title>, ‘rottenness’, def. 3), as in George Herbert’s poem, ‘The Church Porch’, which asks readers to weigh the pleasures of lust against the joys of moderation, and cautions, ‘If rottennesse have more, let Heaven go’ (<bibl>‘Perirrhanteum’, in <title rend="italic">The Works of George Herbert</title>, ed. F. E. Hutchinson (Oxford University Press, 1941), 6–24, line 18</bibl>). Being ‘rotten’ suggests an inner weakness concealed beneath a healthy exterior, as in a rotten bough, or as in medical descriptions of festering sores. The term appears on several occasions in the Bible, most notably in Proverbs 12.4, ‘A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones’; Proverbs 14.30, ‘A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones’; and Habakkuk 3.16, ‘When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones …’ (all KJV).</note></seg>; that thou wilt ungratefull prove;</rdg>

However, it also possessed its modern meaning of something physical or palpable.
