                <rdg wit="#ft"><note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note></rdg>
                  <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>
                  <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="editorialnote">This is a diplomatic transcription in which original spelling, punctuation, and spacing between lines are retained. This poem is one of five poems written near the end of the poetry section of the manuscript in a different hand from the main scribe’s. That scribe makes no use in this poem of any abbreviations or scribal signs and so a pure, diplomatic transcription, in which every original feature of the manuscript is replicated, can be done without leading to any alienation for the modern reader, who may find these features cryptic. These notes point out parallels I see with other writers, and particularly women writers, with the aims of placing Pulter in dialogue with ideas explored by other women around this time, and of tracing a kind of female poetic lineage or alternate canon.</note></rdg>

              <app type="headnote">
                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">The taut lines and short stanzas here epitomize the tension in the speaker’s plea to God, which is not simply for God to end but to “crown” her sufferings on earth, perhaps in recognition of what the speaker proceeds to demonstrate: her fervent faith in his mercy and justice, despite her unremitting experience of grief, tears, and sighs. That earthly experience is contrasted with an anticipated dissolution of her corporeal being, one which is (as is typical in Pulter’s poems) not imagined as a loss but as a reconfiguration of particles, or a rewriting of divine poetic “figures.” With this metaphorical term for metaphor, as in subsequent lines, the speaker quietly likens herself and God as writers, each composing a book which features her: “poor wretched me, each part, / E’en all my soul, my thoughts, my heart.” She is confident God reads her aright in either his own records or her verse, wherein her love is made “plain.” The poem’s condensed form contrasts vividly with the expansive plenitude of multiple worlds toward which its vision tends.</note></rdg>
                <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">This lyric skilfully links discourses of religion, alchemy, and natural philosophy (or science), and demonstrates their congruence for this mid-seventeenth-century writer. Formally this poem is written in nine three-line stanzas, featuring two lines of rhyming tetrameter followed by a line of dimeter that rhymes with the dimeter lines in the following two stanzas. This exact stanzaic structure does not appear to be used elsewhere in Pulter’s poetry, though <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="24">How Long Shall My Dejected Soul</ref> and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="29">My Soul’s Sole Desire</ref> are similar.</note></rdg>

As David Norbrook and Reid Barbour explain in their introduction to Lucy Hutchinson’s translation of Lucretius’s <title rend="italic">De rerum natura</title>, by the 1650s many English natural philosophers were engaging with Epicurean theories such as atomism and were reconciling them with Christianity (<title rend="italic">The Works of Lucy Hutchinson</title>, volume 1, Oxford University Press, 2011, pp. xxix-xxxiii).</note></seg> am dispers’d,</rdg>

                  <rdg wit="#ae">I in their <seg>dances<note type="critical">Other early modern writers characterized the movement of atoms as “dancing.” For example, in <title rend="italic">The darkness of atheisme expelled by the light of nature, or, The existence of a deity, and his creation and government of the world demonstrated from reason and the light of nature only</title> (1683), Henry Care articulates with horror the claims of atheists: “The Beauty and Harmony of the world they’l tell you, is only caused by the curious motion of Dancing Atoms, or the apt, yet fortuitous concurrence of Actives with Passives” (sig. B2v). Lucy Hutchinson, in her polemical manuscript dedication to her translation of Lucretius, which Norbrook and Barbour explain takes the stance of a reformed sinner, writes, “All these, and all the other poore deluded instructors of the Gentiles, are guilty of no lesse Impiety, ignorance &amp; folly then this Lunatick [i.e., Lucretius], who not able to diue into the true Originall &amp; Cause of Beings &amp; Accidents, admires them who devizd this Casuall, Irrationall dance of Attomes” (<title rend="italic">The Works of Lucy Hutchinson</title>, volume 1, pp. 7-9). But for Margaret Cavendish (many of whose poems in <title rend="italic">Poems and fancies</title> [1653] treat atoms), the dance of atoms is a more orderly phenomenon: see “A World made by Atomes” and “Motion directs, while Atomes dance” in <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Margaret Cavendish’s Dancing Atoms</ref> in the Curations for this poem.</note></seg> am <seg>unvers’d<note type="gloss">untutored</note></seg>,</rdg>

The terminology of “figures” is often used in relation to atomistic movement at this time.

For a playfully gendered perspective, in which she claims that if a male motion had not persuaded female atoms to be his bawds (or procurers of prostitutes) in order to create a variety of young female forms or figures to delight him then they would have stayed unchanged in one shape, see Cavendish’s “Motion makes Atomes a Bawd for Figure” in <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Margaret Cavendish’s female figures</ref> in the Curations for this poem.</note></seg> tost,</rdg>

Loughlin, Sandra Bell, and Patricia Brace, Broadview, 2012, p. 218). Pulter’s speaker does not share Locke’s Calvinist anguish about his or her wretchedness without God’s grace. Pulter trusts in God’s mercy (l.5) and knows that he is “Just” (l. 18) in protecting every atom of her being, while Locke begs God for mercy and imagines his justice taking the form of severe punishment for the speaker’s unworthiness.</note></seg> thee.</rdg>
