            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

              <note type="editorialnote">In my editions, I prioritize accessibility and multiple interpretive possibilities. To prepare these poems for a wide range of readers, I have modernized erratic early modern spelling, punctuation, and capitalization to conform to standard American usage. I gloss archaic definitions and confusing syntax, and I expand contractions, unless needed to maintain the integrity of the poem’s form. My notes investigate how Pulter’s poems engage with the literature and culture of mid-seventeenth-century England. At the same time, I emphasize how her poems are unique, how they respond to one another and seem to reveal their author’s individual circumstances and philosophies. It is worth noting that although Pulter’s poems survive in only one known source, they are not necessarily stable texts. The source manuscript features variants and revisions that invite multiple interpretations. I encourage readers to refer to the manuscript transcriptions and images on this site; my notes alert readers when the manuscript’s original spelling or physical features are especially worth considering.</note>

          <rdg wit="#ee">
              <note type="headnote">How might Christian parents take example from animals who mother well? In this poem, the speaker seems to be defensive about possible objections to parents who are indulgent or lenient with their children. The poem’s erudition is signalled by marginal notes throughout, which corroborate information about animal habits, particularly by citing a 1621 book of commentary on the poetry of the famous French poet, Du Bartas. Drawing from this commentator’s details about female birds, beasts, sharks, and snakes, Pulter is able to show off her up-to-date knowledge of natural history while also wittily defending an unusual kind of seeming maternal cannibalism—those creatures who seem to incorporate and eat their young to protect them. The marginal commentator, which seems to offer Pulter’s information in the scribe’s hand, backs up its textual sources with testimony that one such creature was seen at a local fair. Pulter’s poem thus situates itself in a conversation that intersects poetic religious verse and a seventeenth-century version of zoology along with popular entertainment, while employing a textual apparatus that raises the issue of how we know what we know. Given Pulter’s poignant elegies on the death of her daughter elsewhere in the collection, and given the violence required in this poem to ensure true protection, this emblem perhaps goes beyond its moral approval of good parenting to reveal anxiety about whether humans can protect their offspring. The speaker asks, if animals are so lovingly protective as mothers, why can’t “we” Christians be the same? She then recovers her ground and fiercely denounces severe and negligent parents as having lost their humanity altogether.</note>

          <rdg wit="#ae">
              <note type="headnote">What can a mother do to protect her children? This emblem searches the natural world for models and finds an extreme possibility in an animal Pulter calls a “cannibal.” This creature, which carries its young in a “wallet” under its breast to protect them from predators, might be a marsupial (perhaps an American opossum or an Australian possum) or a mythical beast. The poem compares this creature to sea foxes and vipers, animals thought to ingest their mates, young, or mothers. In several other poems, Pulter advocates “indulgent” parenting, which she defines as the opposite of neglectful: loving children deeply and doing whatever it takes to keep them safe. Here she extends that argument to claim that we find such indulgence in nature, supporting the conclusion that parental indulgence is both natural and wise. Yet there is something horrifying lurking in the poem’s monsters, reference to danger, and central animal, whose name more commonly means a savage beast that eats its own kind. As the poem celebrates parents who “indulge” their children, it hints at darker implications of being an overprotective mother.</note>

The marginal note then provides the source of this information as a commentary on the poems of Guillaume de Saluste du Bartas, the renowned French sixteenth-century religious poet. The marginal note refers specifically to Simon Goulart’s commentary on Du Bartas’s <title rend="italic">Semaines</title> (“Weeks”), epic poems expounding on the book of Genesis in the Bible, which were divided into the days of the week of creation. See <bibl>Simon Goulart, <title rend="italic">A Learned Summary Upon the Famous Poem of William of Salust, Lord Bartas</title> (London,1621), 5<add place="above">th</add> day, p. 241.</bibl></note></seg> there be, sure they no love do lack,</rdg>

Ii1r). Goulart describes this bird as shrouded in mystery and the subject of fables: it has no feet or wings but somehow remains perpetually in the air and therefore is never observed unless dead. A bird that transcends the earth appeals to the desire expressed by many of Pulter’s poems to move past mortal suffering and focus on heavenly reward. Pulter writes in more detail about birds of paradise (“manucodiats”) in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="71">The Manucodiats (Emblem 5)</ref>, including their generosity and parental unity when laying and protecting eggs.</note></seg> there be, sure they no love do lack,</rdg>

This poem does go on in later lines, however, to tease out the other meanings of this term by pointing to other animals that use a strikingly benevolent form of temporary cannibalism to protect their young. A marginal note in this poem directs the reader to information on this maternal creature (perhaps a possum) in Goulart’s commentary on Du Bartas’s poetry (in the section, “the 6<add place="above">th</add> Day”; although the page noted is 165, the correct page number is 265). The marginal note then testifies that the beast had been seen at Baldock Fair in 1653. “Baldock is a town in Hertfordshire, not far from where Pulter lived, which traditionally held fairs on the feasts of St. James, St. Andrew, and St. Matthew (July 25, November 30, and September 21)” (Eardley). The word “cunning” can simply mean clever practical skill, but it could hint of a deceptive craftiness.</note></seg></rdg>

Philemon Holland’s 1603 translation of <bibl>Plutarch’s <title rend="italic">The Philosophy</title></bibl> describes it as an especially clever fish: “The sea fox will not many times come near unto a hook, he recoileth back and is afraid of some deceitful guile; but say that he chance to be surprised quickly, he maketh shift to wind himself off again: for such is his strength, agility and slippery moisture withal that he will turn himself upside down with his tail upward, in such sort, that when by overturning his stomach all within is come forth, it can not choose but the hook looseth the hold which it had and falleth forth” (p. 971). At this moment in Pulter’s manuscript, a marginal note cites Simon Goulart’s commentary on <bibl>Du Bartas’s <title rend="italic">Semaines</title> (1621)</bibl>, the fifth day. Goulart identifies the sea fox as a predatory fish with a long tail who loves its young: “if any danger happen them, he presently swalloweth them down and keepeth them alive in his body, then being escaped, he casteth them up as he received them” (sig. Ff3r-Ff3v). A second note in Pulter’s manuscript draws attention to Goulart, Pliny, and Plutarch on the stork—a bird that does not appear in this poem.</note></seg> all fishes doth outgo</rdg>

            <rdg wit="#ae">The <seg>viper<note type="gloss">A small venomous snake native to England and Europe. Vipers were fabled to be cannibalistic during both reproduction and birth. According to Pliny’s <title rend="italic">Natural History</title>, the female viper bites off the male’s head during mating for her “pleasure and delectation.” She then lays eggs “within her belly,” and once the first young viper is delivered, “the rest (impatient of so long delay) eat through the sides of their dam, and kill her.” See <bibl>Philemon Holland’s translation titled <title rend="italic">The History of the World</title> (1601), book 10, chapter 62, sig. Dd1r.</bibl></note></seg> so her younglings swallows down—</rdg>
