            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

              <note type="editorialnote">This is a semi-diplomatic transcription in which original spelling and punctuation are retained, abbreviations (such as tildes) are expanded with added letters in italics, “ff” is modernized to “F,” superscriptions are lowered, and major alterations to the text (of a word or more, not individual letters) are noted in the footnotes. The retention of original spelling and punctuation has the potential to get us closer to the choices made by the poet and scribe, but some scribal details (such as abbreviations) do not seem substantive or meaning-bearing and run the risk of alienating a modern reader. The notes point out parallels I see with other writers, and particularly women writers, with the aims of placing Pulter in dialogue with ideas explored by other women around this time, and of tracing a kind of female poetic lineage or alternate canon.</note>

              <note type="headnote">In Pulter’s manuscript, this poem’s conclusion is oddly separated from what precedes it by a sizeable gap—oddly, but also appropriately, since the final lines comprise a vision of the speaker’s final and total liberation from the confinement that the rest of the poem condemns. The envoy indicates the speaker’s confidence that death shall free her scattered atoms to “surround” our universe and recombine to “give a being to another world.” This liberated vision of liberation calmly counteracts the long litany of preceding complaints, in which the speaker rails against the injustice of a vast array of other, implicitly lower, creatures living freely while she cannot (she never explains why). If this part of the poem grows tiresome in repeating its formula, that tiresome formulaic repetition itself might itself model the experience she describes. But she also poignantly expresses concern for loved ones she is powerless to help while stuck in a situation (in apparent solitude and geographic isolation) utterly at odds with the mental freedom she desires, thinks she deserves, and (given world enough and time) envisions arriving with her transformation from being “buried … alive” on earth to experiencing a cosmic exhumation after death.</note>
          </rdg>
          <rdg wit="#ae">
              <note type="headnote"><p>In this poem the speaker repeatedly uses the language of confinement and restraint. She offers a catalogue of natural creatures who are free, contrasting each with her own immurement inside her house. Some of the creatures mentioned in Pulter’s catalogue are mentioned in the plural and so are not obviously gendered, but many of the individual creatures are female. In several poems, particularly her emblems, Pulter notes the gender of specific animals, giving her analysis an additional relevance to human behaviour (for example, see her laughing female tortoise in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="79">The Porcupine</ref>). Animals gendered female in this poem are the bee, beetle, silkworm, catoblepas, amphisbaena, oyster, flying fish, halcyon, swan, ostrich, turtle-dove, cuckoo, su, and canibal. In her discussions of the swan, ostrich, cuckoo, su, and canibal (and obliquely also the halcyon), she refers to their roles as mothers, and the ungendered raven is also a parent. In the case of the turtle-dove she highlights its constancy to one mate, as was typical in references to this bird.</p>
                  <p>A few poems earlier in the manuscript, Pulter contrasts her confinement in a natural setting with the movement of the planets: “Must I be still confined to this sad grove / Whenas those vast and glorious globes above / Eternally in treble motions move?” (<ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="54">A Solitary Complaint</ref>, ll. 1-3). The exact cause of her confinement in Poem 57 is not stated, but the vivid image of being “tied to one habitation” (l. 14) and “shut up in a country grange” (l. 18) suggests that she is required to stay at home, perhaps due to conflict during the civil war. Another meaning of confinement, the period of being in bed after giving birth to a child, was not current until 1774 (<title rend="italic">OED</title> 4) and so it is not likely the meaning here, though the title of Poem 45 makes clear that she wrote at least one poem soon after childbirth (<ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="45">This Was Written in 1648, When I Lay in, With my Son John</ref>).</p>
                <p>The situation of the speaker in Poem 57 invites a comparison with the motif of retreat or retirement often used by royalist writers: numerous critics have seen political significance in images of retreating to nature in poems of the 1640s and 1650s. With an exiled and then murdered king, cavalier poets depicted retreat as the rejection of the world in favour of erotic fulfilment (e.g., Abraham Cowley’s “The Wish”) or as a kind of alternate political action, among other possibilities. Hero Chalmers explains that “As royalists began to be forced into retreat by the sequestration of their estates, ejection from public office, imprisonment, or exile during the 1640s, a rhetoric of paradox emerged in the work of cavalier poets eager to convert withdrawal into self-assertion, disenfranchisement into power, confinement into freedom, and so on” (<title rend="italic">Royalist Women Writers 1650-1689</title>, Clarendon Press, 2004, p. 105). Katherine Philips, who like Pulter was a royalist poet, wrote a number of poems about retirement from the world which celebrate female friendship (for example, in “Friendship’s Mystery, To my dearest Lucasia” she writes “We court our own Captivity … ’Twere banishment to be set free” [ll. 16, 18]; see <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Versifying Captivity</ref> in Curations for this poem). Retreat, for Pulter, is not an escape to an idyllic natural landscape, but instead a kind of imprisonment which she must suffer alone. Royalist writers also used imagery of imprisonment in their verse, sometimes to reflect their actual incarceration during the 1640s, as in the famous poem by Richard Lovelace “To Althea, From Prison” (see <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Versifying Captivity</ref> in Curations for this poem). The typical movement in poems such as Lovelace’s is to contrast the speaker’s actual restraint with their inner freedom. Lovelace claims to be more free than gods, fish, and winds, but Pulter’s speaker does not celebrate; she links confinement with being “buried thus alive” (l. 20) and “enslaved to solitude” (l. 75). In this poem the speaker’s attitude to her confinement is entirely negative; while her mind is still free, she knows that true freedom will come only after death.</p>
                  <p>In addition to a work of natural history that we know Pulter read (Philemon Holland’s translation of Pliny’s <title rend="italic">The historie of the world</title>), and works that she may or may not have read (Edward Topsell’s compilations on four-footed beasts and on serpents), other contemporary sources that she could have known offer catalogues of animals in relation to God’s creation of the world (Josuah Sylvester’s translation of Du Bartas, Simon Goulart’s commentary on Du Bartas, and John Swan’s <title rend="italic">Speculum mundi</title>; for full references see the relevant footnotes below). Thomas Browne discusses a catalogue of creatures in <title rend="italic">Pseudodoxia epidemica</title>, “almost an encyclopaedia of seventeenth-century misconceptions and new knowledge” (R.H. Robbins, ODNB entry on Browne).</p>

Male stag beetles have large mouth parts resembling antlers, probably used in fighting. Dung beetles form balls of feces as food and protection for their larvae, and may roll the balls quite far before burying them. Pliny indicated that “tumbling upon their back in dung, [dung beetles] do roll it into great round balls with their feet; and therein doe make nests for to bestow the little grubs (which are their young) against the cold of winter.” Trans. Philemon Holland, <title rend="italic">The History of the World</title> (London, 1601), 1:326. The idea of the beetle rolling dung from east to west to call “great Nature” alludes to the ancient Egyptian tendency to compare the scarab beetle rolling a ball of dung along the ground to the sun god rolling the sun across the sky.</note></seg> <seg>casts<note type="gloss">sheds</note></seg> her stag-like horns,</rdg>

Though this image of cocooning may suggest confinement, the poet indicates that the silkworm does this temporarily to reproduce, but then flies freely until her death. In this context of the female silkworm, to “work” may have the sense of the female labour of weaving, sewing, or embroidering (<title rend="italic">OED</title> 25). In her autobiography, <title rend="italic">A True Relation of my Birth, Breeding, and Life</title>, which was appended to <title rend="italic">Natures Pictures drawn by Fancies Pencil to the Life</title> (1656), Margaret Cavendish refers to the silkworm’s self-sufficiency and to its labour of spinning to illustrate her own process of poetic creation: “yet I must say this in the behalf of my thoughts, that I never found them idle; for if the senses brings no work in, they will work of themselves, like silk-wormes that spinns out of their own bowels” (<title rend="italic">Paper Bodies: A Margaret Cavendish Reader</title>, edited by Sylvia Bowerbank and Sara Mendelson, Broadview, 2000, p. 59). John Swan describes the bombyx or silk-worm in his <title rend="italic">Speculum mundi, Or A glasse representing the face of the world shewing both that it did begin, and must also end: the manner how, and time when, being largely examined. Whereunto is joyned an hexameron, or a serious discourse of the causes, continuance, and qualities of things in nature; occasioned as matter pertinent to the work done in the six dayes of the worlds creation</title> (1635), pp. 425-426. He uses the language of breaking free from a prison which is also a house, which parallels Pulter’s imagery in this poem: “when these daintie creatures have made them little husken houses, and spunne out the just length of their silken webs, they eat out themselves from those prisons; and (although they were worms before) yet then they appeare with their prettie wings, and flie about a while” (p. 426). I am grateful to Jessica Wolfe for drawing my attention to Swan and for discussing Thomas Browne with me (for the latter, see below).</note></seg>,</rdg>

With this animal Pulter moves from her examples of insects to what we would consider to be fantastical creatures. Not all sixteenth- and seventeenth-century writers would have agreed with modern conceptions that this was a mythical beast, however. In his <title rend="italic">Pseudodoxia epidemica, or, Enquiries into very many received tenents and commonly presumed truths</title> (1646), p. 118-121, Thomas Browne investigates various claims about the basilisk, observing (perhaps surprisingly in a work that tests received wisdom) “that such an animall there is, if we evade not the testimony of Scripture, and humane Writers, we cannot safely deny” (p. 118). Edward Topsell in his <title rend="italic">The historie of serpents. Or, The second booke of liuing creatures wherein is contained their diuine, naturall, and morall descriptions, with their liuely figures, names, conditions, kindes and natures of all venemous beasts: with their seuerall poysons and antidotes; their deepe hatred to mankind, and the wonderfull worke of God in their creation, and destruction. Necessary and profitable to all sorts of men: collected out of diuine scriptures, fathers, phylosophers, physitians, and poets: amplified with sundry accidentall histories, hierogliphicks, epigrams, emblems, and aenigmaticall obseruations</title> (1608), p. 125, describes the basilisk’s venom as noxious to humans in particular (see <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">“Creatures venomous, and offensive to man”</ref> in Curations for this poem; Topsell compares the corrupting beams that issue from a basilisk’s eyes to those from a menstruating woman which impair a mirror). Josuah Sylvester, in his translation <title rend="italic">Du Bartas his deuine weekes and workes</title> (1611), p. 149, describes the basilisk as having “pestilentiall breath / [which] Doth pearce firm Marble, and whose banefull ey / Wounds with a glance, so that the soundest dy.” The basilisk, dipsas, and amphisbaena all figure in Sylvester’s list of “Creatures venomous, and offensive to man” (pp. 148-149). Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, writer of an influential work celebrating women which was translated into English in 1652, writes about the gender of the basilisk. The full title of this work is, <title rend="italic">The glory of women: or, A treatise declaring the excellency and preheminence of women above men, which is proved both by scripture, law, reason, and authority, divine, and humane. Written first in Latine by Henricus Cornelius Agrippa Knight, and doctor both of law and physicke. And presented to Margaret Augusta, Queen of the Austrians and Burgundians. And now translated into English, for the vertuous and beautifull female sex of the Commonwealth of England By Edw. Fleetwood, Gent</title>. In the context of a discussion that sometimes men are worse than the worst of women, Agrippa writes, “Furthermore, the Scriptures declare many men to be condemned to eternal torments, when no woman at any time condemned may be read of: to this may be added in way of testimony a prerogative of brutish nature, because the Eagle which is Queen of all Birds, always of the Female, never of the Male is found: &amp; it is said, that there is but one only Phaenix, and that a Female, which is in Egypt. But on the contrary, of the Serpent, which hath its name from King, I mean the <hi rend="italic">Basiliske</hi>, the most poysonous of all venemous creatures, there is none except a Male, which is impossible to be gendered a Female” (p. 18).

Plinius Secundus. Translated into English by Philemon Holland Doctor of Physicke</title> (1634, p. 206) groups the basilisk and catoblepas together as venomous serpents whose looks have the power to kill. See <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">“Creatures venomous, and offensive to man”</ref> in Curations for this poem for Pliny’s description of these beasts. Like Pliny, whose natural history we know Pulter consulted, given other references in her manuscript, Pulter groups them together (“Though these destroy yet may they freely Range,” l. 17). Pliny attributes the killing of grass and herbs to the basilisk, not the catoblepas, and genders both creatures male. Pulter genders the catoblepas female but does not give the basilisk a gender (see Agrippa’s claim, above, that the basilisk was always male). Pulter’s choice to gender this evil creature as female reminds us that she does not simply depict examples of positive female behaviour in her verse.

Pulter is likely referring to Broadfield (or Bradfield), which was the name of the estate in the parish of Cottered in Hertfordshire owned by the Pulters. Henry Chauncy’s <title rend="italic">The Historical Antiquities of Hertfordshire</title> of 1700 gives the history of the estate, noting that Arthur Pulter retired to Bradfield shortly after the outbreak of the civil war. There he “liv’d a retir’d Life, and thro’ the importunity of his Wife, began to build a very fair House of Brick upon this Mannor, but dying he never finished it” (p. 72). His grandson James Forester ultimately “repaired the Mannor-House, which was much decay’d thro’ the want of finishing it at the time it was built” (p. 74). Perhaps some of Pulter’s despair at her domestic immurement was due to living in an unfinished renovation site.</note></seg></rdg>

Neither can they at all be cured, unless by hearing musick: and (as it is reported) if the cure be not throughly done, they dance ever after at the sound of musicks pleasing strains” (<title rend="italic">Speculum mundi</title> [1635], p. 425).</note></seg></rdg>

Her use of the term noble in the following line recalls the “noble Freedome of my Mind” (of l. 2), as well as the “Noble Freedome” of the birds of paradise (l. 44), and looks ahead to her willingness to suffer this confinement for a “Noble End” (ll. 93-94), such as her God, king, country, friend, love, or children.</note></seg></rdg>

Swan, after describing the myth of Alcyone and Ceyx who were turned into halcyons, writes, “But without any fiction, this we are sure of, that it is a strange bird, and as it were natures dearest darling; seeing that in favour of her nests and young, the waters leave their raging, the windes their blowing, tempests have forgot to rise, and dayes appeare with quiet calms” (<title rend="italic">Speculum mundi</title> [1635], p. 417). The phrase “halcyon days” was used by royalists to depict the calm of Charles I’s reign before the civil war; Dolores Palomo notes that the myth of the halcyon was rarely used before 1630 by English writers, but that for three decades after that date it was a charged symbol of lost peace (“The Halcyon Moment of Stillness in Royalist Poetry,” <title rend="italic">Huntington Library Quarterly</title>, vol. 44, no. 3, Summer 1981, pp. 205-221 [p. 206]). Pulter herself uses the phrase “halcyon days” in two explicitly royalist poems that lament Charles’s imprisonment in 1647, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="2">The Invitation into the Country</ref>, l. 111 and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="4">The Complaint of Thames, 1647</ref>, l. 36.</note></seg> that Calms the Rufling Seas</rdg>

The cuckoo was etymologically linked with, and became popularly associated with, the term cuckold, “a derisive name for the husband of an unfaithful wife” (<title rend="italic">OED</title>), but in the popular imagination it is the male cuckoo who deposits its eggs in another bird’s nest, with the implication being that he has impregnated another man’s wife. Shakespeare’s comedy <title rend="italic">Love’s Labour’s Lost</title> ends with the song of the owl and the cuckoo: the refrain for the latter is “The cuckoo then on every tree / Mocks married men; for thus sings he: / ‘Cuckoo! / Cuckoo, cuckoo!’ O, word of fear, / Unpleasing to a married ear” (5.2.886-890, 895-899; edited by H.R. Woudhuysen, Arden edition, third series, Thomas Nelson and Sons, 1998, p. 295). Pulter focuses on the baby cuckoo’s ingratitude, and perhaps also by extension the mother cuckoo’s ingratitude to the family who raises her offspring, rather than the bird’s association with cuckoldry. Swan discusses the cuckoo’s association with both ingratitude and cuckoldry (see <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Good and Bad Animal Parents</ref> in Curations for this poem). For another treatment of the cuckoo, see Pulter’s <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="94">The Cuckoo (Emblem 29)</ref>.</note></seg> which is wors</rdg>

          <rdg wit="#ae">The <seg>Cannibal<note type="critical">According to Simon Goulart, the canibal is a small animal from the West Indies who hides her offspring in a pouch in her belly (<title rend="italic">A learned summary</title> [1621], p. 265; see <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Good and Bad Animal Parents</ref> in Curations for his description). The first sentence of Goulart’s description locates canibals in the country of Chiurca (possibly the island of Curaçao). Sylvester, in <title rend="italic">Du Bartas his deuine weekes and workes</title>, lists a number of “Fierce and vntameable beasts,” the last of which he particularly fears: “I fear the Beast, bred in the bloody Coast / Of <hi rend="italic">Cannibals</hi>, which thousand times (almost) / Re-whelps her whelps, and in her tender womb, / She doth as oft her living brood re-tomb” ([1611], p. 152). Syntactically, a beast that lives in “the bloody Coast of Cannibals” suggests a beast that lives in the coast populated by human cannibals, but the description of the beast, and the marginal reference to “<hi rend="italic">Chiurcae</hi>,” makes it likely that Sylvester means the fantastical animal called the canibal.

Another beast mentioned in one of the contemporary natural histories who protects her children from harm is the whale. Swan’s <title rend="italic">Speculum mundi</title> (1635), p. 368 notes of the “Balaena” that “it is a fish which shews great love and affection towards her young ones: For when they are little, being faint and weak, she takes them into her mouth to secure them from tempestuous surges; and when the tempest is over, she spues them again out into the sea. A fit embleme this, to teach all sorts of parents either in Church, Commonwealth, or private families, to provide for, and not destroy those under them; as also to secure them from dangers whensoever they arise.” Though Pulter mentions the whale as vast and free (above, ll. 31-32) she does not mention its maternal actions.</note></seg></rdg>
