            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

            <note type="editorialnote">Our priority in editing these poems has been to modernise, and to achieve interpretative and visual clarity, in order to make the poems as accessible as possible to as wide a modern audience as is possible. Spelling is modernised, as is punctuation. Modernising the latter, in particular, often involves a significant act of editorial interpretation, but in our view this is one of the most productive areas of editorial intervention, particularly for a manuscript text such as Pulter’s where the punctuation is erratic compared to modern usage (and, indeed, compared to early modern printed texts). <seg>1<note>1.

              <note type="headnote">Hissing and cheering urban spectators gather to witness a duel between the forces of right and wrong. In this emblem, Pulter imagines parliamentarian and royalist battling in the English civil war as an allegorical contest reminiscent of the sporting games of classical Greece. Virtue, supported by her “second” or assistant Wisdom, battles mindfully with a frenzied Fortune, aided by Folly. The poem derides London citizens who desperately want Virtue to be bested, and are giddy with happiness when Folly is triumphant. As is typical in Pulter’s emblems, the speaker explicitly interprets the allegory by applying it to the current political situation, daring her reader to feel superior to the foolish crowds (or to see any victory as a sign of its intrinsic righteousness) since all have been complicit in witnessing the destruction of natural and divine law by wickedness (“impiety”). The poem ends with a lament for King Charles’s death, and a hope that Charles II might be restored to the throne, an act that the poem aligns with the resurrection of Christ (God’s “princely son”).</note>

          <rdg wit="#ae">
              <note type="headnote"><p>Drawing on the didacticism that is present throughout Pulter’s emblem collection, this poem overtly politicizes the instructive affordances of the emblem genre. In this emblem, Virtue (with Wisdom as her “second”) fights a duel with Fortune (and her “second”, Folly), and the people of the city support Fortune and Folly (lines 2, 4). The poem’s final tercet makes overt the implications of these personifications: Virtue is associated with King Charles I, whom Pulter ardently supported, while Oliver Cromwell, republican and Lord Protector following Charles’s execution, is associated with Fortune, which here means chance or luck (<title rend="italic">OED</title> 1). Pulter has these two characters oppose each other in an “Olympic” duel and, true to this genre’s form, the emblem takes a moralising turn at line 21, condemning the actions of Fortune and Folly. Notably, Pulter uses the female pronouns “her” and “she” when personifying these qualities, feminizing her bitter depiction of the Civil War in contrast to the male figures she alludes to. The representations of these qualities do often take the form of feminized personification; in Wither’s emblem collection of 1635, multiple representations of Fortune depict her as “fickle … [in] the Favour she bestows”, using “slippery tricks” to tempt men, while Virtue offers “Her [beauty]” and “Her safe direction” (<title rend="italic">A Collection of Emblemes</title> [1635], 6, 174, 22). See Curation.</p>
                  <p>Pulter’s characterization of Cromwell and his parliamentarian supporters resonates with her previous representations of republican supporters in the earlier emblems. Pulter’s Nimrod in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="67">Mighty Nimrod (Emblem 1)</ref> has the same ambitious, “usurping” qualities which she identifies in the “[giddy]” and “[impious]” nature of Fortune and Folly, creating a continuity in her political message which is pursued throughout the emblem series (line 18; lines 4, 24). This poem grieves the “laws / Of God and nature” which have been “basely trampled on”, and employs a rhyming tercet to conclude the poem (lines 22-23). This contrasts with the rhyming couplets that precede it, drawing attention to the political intentions motivating the personified qualities. The final line looks to consolation via the restoration of the “princely son”, Charles II (line 27). This eventually occurred in May 1660, some years after Pulter is believed to have written the emblem.</p>

In the Renaissance, however, new attitudes towards duels resulted in attempts to ban them. James I published a treatise in 1616 outlawing the practice and similar movements to control the sport were seen across Europe, including in France under Louis XIII; see <title rend="italic">The Works of the Most High and Mighty Prince, James</title> [1616], 207. It is interesting then that Pulter makes the duel the subject of this politically charged emblem, emphasising open conflict (“the fray”, line 5) and perhaps the unruliness of Fortune, who disobeys the rules for power and honour by “madly la[ying] about” (line 10).</note></seg>,</rdg>

For most of the 1650s, however, he lived in exile in France, until, on 29 May 1660, he was crowned King Charles II of England. Pulter’s appeal in this final line suggests that the emblem was composed during the 1650s, prior to Charles’s restoration.</note></seg> restore.</rdg>
