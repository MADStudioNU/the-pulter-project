                        The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers,
                        which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and
                        punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might
                        otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not
                        modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote
                        aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by
                        Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to
                        allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various
                        possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure
                        material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford
                        Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s
                        edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The
                        result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.

                      <p>My priority in editing these poems has been to modernise, and to achieve interpretative and visual clarity, in order to make the poems as accessible as possible to as wide a modern audience as is possible. Spelling is modernised, as is punctuation. Modernising the latter, in particular, often involves a significant act of editorial interpretation, but in my view this is one of the most productive areas of editorial intervention, particularly for a manuscript text such as Pulter’s where the punctuation is erratic compared to modern usage (and, indeed, compared to early modern printed texts).<seg>1<note type="critical">1.

                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">At nightfall, in stanzas that allude to the folksy and familiar meter of popular ballads, the speaker soothes her saddened soul; but the proffered solace might seem cold comfort, since it requires the embrace of death (a precondition of a promised return to life). The speaker thus broadens her address to hail the Fates, who are dared, in a nearly paradoxical rhyme, to do “right” by the speaker through their “spite”: that is, she invites them to kill her. This careless bravado extends to her boasted fearlessness of the classical Furies, and her contentment to lie down in her grave; but the poem’s incongruous final image, likening that grave—the earth, and hence her “cause”—to her “finest downy bed,” revives some of the disquiet of the opening scene.</note></rdg>
                <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">
                  <p>Like many of Pulter’s religious poems, this one begins as an address to her “melancholy soul” (2), encouraging it to desist in its spiritual complaint. “Night” and “light” are in this context representations of death and life, and Pulter uses the “revolution” of day and night to figure a cycle of “life and death and life” (12); that is, life, death, and resurrection. The poem builds as it progresses on a set of ideas and images that recurs throughout Pulter’s poems: the “dissolution” (disintegration into elements or dust) of the body in death, and the interrelated process of “revolution” (alteration, change, transmutation of elements) or renewal in God’s love. Pulter sees life, death, and renewal in God as a circular process, and “revolution” is a word and image she uses repeatedly for this positive transformation in God: “revolution / Is the preserving of the universe / From dissolution” (lines 18-20). Revolution is, then, an image for the way in which Christ’s sacrifice has conquered death: “Death at last is conquered quite, / O happy victory!” (7-8). For the biblical sources for this idea, see note to lines 7-8 (below); and among Pulter’s other poems, see <ref target="/" corresp="1" type="pp-poem-ref">The Eclipse</ref>, especially lines 43-8 and 65-6; and <ref target="/" corresp="48" type="pp-poem-ref">Immense Fount of Truth</ref>.</p>
                  <p>Pulter’s devotional musings on dissolution and revolution are distinctive and recurrent. She commonly pairs “dissolve / revolve” and “dissolution / revolution” in rhyme, as she does in stanzas 3 and 5 of this poem. “The Eclipse” has very similar concerns, and uses this rhyme three times; in that poem, revolution is a “passage” to eternal love (line 45). She uses the same rhyme in the poem immediately following this one, “Immense Fount of Truth”; in that poem, “the stairs of revolution” enable the speaker to “attain thy radiant throne above” (lines 5-6). See the amplified edition of “Immense Fount of Truth”, edited by Elizabeth Scott-Baumann.</p>
                    <p>In the last three stanzas of the poem, Pulter melds her concept of dissolution and revolution with other of her recurring images: those of dust and “causes”, the elements or matter from which the body is first produced, and to which it returns in death. Pulter’s dust is analogous to George Herbert’s, whose “Easter” she may echo in the “dust / just” rhyme of lines 22 and 24. Herbert’s lines are “as his death calcined thee to dust, / His life may make thee gold, and much more just” (lines 5-6); see also <ref target="/" corresp="49" type="pp-poem-ref">My Heart Why Do Thou Throb So in My Breast?</ref>. For a similar sense of “causes” as the dust-like first elements to which one is returned in death, see <ref target="/" corresp="6" type="pp-poem-ref">Universal Dissolution</ref>, lines 14, 32, 46. Present in her use of both terms (“dust”, “causes”) is the sense of dissolution to these elements being necessary for the revolutionary passage into heavenly glory—the “happy victory” over death.</p>
