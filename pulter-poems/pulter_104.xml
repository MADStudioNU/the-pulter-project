            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

            <note type="editorialnote"><p>Given the complexity of this poem’s subject matter, I chose to privilege legibility in my edition by using modern spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. Abbreviations are expanded silently, and superscripts are lowered, although I have preserved some contractions (“to’s,” “int’rest”) where these suit the meter. My “gloss notes” offer definitions of archaic terms (or terms that have shifted in meaning since the seventeenth century), often based on the <title rend="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</title>, as well as paraphrases of difficult sentences. The “critical notes” address Pulter’s literary and social contexts, including the translations of classical texts that she may have known, and the scholarship on dolphins that was circulating during her life.</p><p>I also include contemporary findings in marine biology and cetology when these relate to Pulter’s descriptions of dolphins. In some cases, early modern knowledge is remarkably consistent with modern views, while other recent discoveries highlight the degree to which marine science has changed. Comparing Pulter’s knowledge with modern science reveals our continuing fascination with dolphins, and how little we still understand about these humanlike inhabitants of an alien, oceanic world.</p></note>

              <note type="headnote">Idle hands do the devil’s work, goes the proverb—but in Pulter’s admiring vision, dolphins, hands-free, toil joyfully on the side of angels. Drawing on intersecting tales from ancient myths and natural history, this poem celebrates dolphins as effective panders, fisherfolk, and chauffeurs, not to mention as loyal subjects in their own society and friends to humankind. The sheer length of this catalogue suggests the deliberately active life that the poem idealizes in humans as in dolphins. If these creatures can subsist as perpetual-motion machines, then people (endowed with reason) are exhorted to measure up to their activity, or exceed it. At the very least, they should avoid the deadly sloth the speaker castigates in her peers.</note>

          <rdg wit="#ae">
              <note type="headnote"><p>The charismatic marine mammal at the center of Pulter’s thirty-ninth emblem poem is a tireless mediator. Part allegorical figure representing an industrious life, part diplomat, Pulter’s dolphin moves between mythology and science, between human society and the ocean, and even between deities. Like modern scientists, early modern writers often noted the similarities between dolphins and humans, including their intelligence and tendency to form strong social bonds. For Pulter, this gregarious cetacean prompts reflections on several political and literary topics, including the matrimonial turmoil produced by fifteenth-century military ventures, the restrictions placed on women who have been chosen to marry kings, the horrors of the English Civil War, and a wide array of classical characters, from sea-gods to mullet fishers.</p><p>Above all, this poem engages with the questions of what makes us human, and how we should define the limits of sentience. For early modern writers, the answers should have been simple: humans were the only life forms created in the image of God, and as Aristotle had established, the only species with the capacity for rational thought<seg>1<note type="gloss"><bibl>Aristotle, <title rend="italic">De Anima</title>, trans. J[ohn] A[lexander] Smith (Oxford: Clarendon, 1931), 2.3.</bibl></note></seg>. “The Dolphin” is indeed primarily concerned with human conduct, and Pulter’s dolphin functions as a carefully constructed metaphor, encouraging readers to become more productive and tenacious. But a dolphin is a slippery subject, cavorting on the boundary between human and nonhuman – flirting with sea-nymphs, sampling wine, and falling in love. Humans, meanwhile, have a great capacity for sloth, and may never measure up to the dolphin’s speed and efficiency. The inevitable conclusion is that we would be better humans if we were more like dolphins. Like many of Pulter’s poems, “The Dolphin” therefore deserves to be read not only for its literary merits, but also for its remarkable views of the (non)human condition, as well as its reflections on seventeenth-century developments in history, philosophy, and science.</p></note>

          <rdg wit="#ee"><seg>All creatures than the dolphin are more slow<note type="critical">The idea that the dolphin was the speediest creature was promulgated by the ancient natural historian Pliny, whose ideas were circulating in English in Pulter’s time: “The swiftest of all other living creatures whatsoever, and not of sea-fish only, is the dolphin” (Pliny the Elder, trans. Philemon Holland, <title rend="italic">The History of the World</title> [London, 1634], volume 1, p. 238).</note></seg></rdg>
          <rdg wit="#ae"><seg>All creatures than the dolphin are more slow<note type="critical">Much of Pulter’s information about the natural world can be traced to Pliny the Elder’s <title rend="italic">Natural History</title> (77–79 CE), which was available in an English translation by Philemon Holland. Pliny begins his chapter on dolphins by stating that this creature is faster than any other animal and “swifter than the arrow shot out of a bow” (<bibl><ref target="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/pliny9.html" type="new-window-url"><title rend="italic">The History of the World</title></ref>, vol. 1, trans. Philemon Holland [London: Adam Islip, 1601], IX.viii, p. 238</bibl>). Pulter inverts Pliny’s statement, emphasizing the slowness of other creatures by placing this word in the rhyming position. In fact, the common dolphin is capable of achieving speeds up to 64 km/h (40 mph), making it the fastest marine mammal, but far slower than the sailfish, which can travel at over 100 km/h (60 mph).</note></seg></rdg>

In the geocentric model of the universe (which had not been fully discredited in Pulter’s time), “fair Cynthia” or the moon marked the boundary between the mutable sublunary region and the unchanging superlunary spheres. The classical elements of earth, water, air, and fire made up everything below the moon, while the superlunary realm was filled with a more refined fifth element known as aether.</p><p>Pulter’s interest in the new heliocentric models advanced by the likes of Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler is evident from poems such as <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="1">“The Eclipse” (Poem 1)</ref> and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="52">“The Wish” (Poem 52)</ref>.

The ostensible sexual passivity of both women and female dolphins was one of many traits that these species were said to share.

Philosophers in this period generally agreed that only humans were capable of true speech, since the abstract thought underlying language required a rational soul. However, Pulter depicts the dolphin as an active mediator on Poseidon’s behalf.On early modern beliefs about animal speech, see <bibl>R[ichard] W.

She may also have been inspired by the active role that Delphinus takes in the <title rend="italic">Poeticon Astronomicon</title>, which states that he “came at last to the maiden, persuaded her to marry Neptunus, and himself took charge of the wedding” (<bibl><title rend="italic">The Myths of Hyginus</title>, ed. and trans.

After Rennes fell, Anne married Charles, despite the fact that Charles was engaged to Maximilian’s eleven-year-old daughter, Margaret. Anne’s marriage to Maximilian was annulled, and Margaret, who had been living at the French court since 1483, returned to Maximilian. Since the marriage contract indicated that Anne would marry Charles’s successor if he died without male heirs, she is also the only woman in history to have become Queen consort of France twice, marrying Charles’s cousin Louis XII (1462–1515) in 1498.</note></seg> wed</rdg>

Yet early modern writers recognized that there were key differences between dolphins and the species that modern scientists classify as Osteichthyes (bony fish); for instance, whales and dolphins were known to produce milk for their offspring. Humans could also interact with air-breathing dolphins in their natural environments, making it easier to study their behaviours and cognitive abilities. In contrast, Myra E. Wright observes that efforts to study bony fish were almost entirely limited to dead specimens; thus “[e]arly modern English fish are deadened, flattened, and removed from their environments in the very texts that celebrate their complex mental lives” (<bibl><title rend="italic">The Poetics of Angling in Early Modern England</title> [New York and Abingdon: Routledge, 2018], p. 4</bibl>).</note></seg> <seg>with fishermen will join<note type="critical"><p>Pliny describes dolphins working with humans to catch mullets off the coast of Languedoc (trans.

Kenneth F. Kitchell Jr. and Irven Michael Resnick [Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 2018], 24.40</bibl>), and the sixteenth-century Dutch fishmonger Adriaen Coenen claimed that dolphins near Narbonne not only herded mullets into fishing nets, but also helped to inspect the nets (<bibl><title rend="italic">The Whale Book: Whales and Other Marine Animals as Described by Adriaen Coenen in 1584</title>, ed.

Bread and wine were central to Roman society; indeed, Cato recommended that a farm worker receive at least 7 quadrantals (approximately 182 L) of wine per year (<bibl><ref target="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/B*.html" type="new-window-url"><title rend="italic">De Agricultura</title></ref>, trans. W. D. Hooper and Harrison Boyd Ash, Loeb Classical Library 283 [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1934], 57, pp. 72-3</bibl>). The dolphins’ appreciation of these treats would therefore have been a sign of their similarities to humans. While it remains unclear whether most mammals enjoy consuming alcohol, this behaviour has been studied in <ref target="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/009130579390232I" type="new-window-url">vervet monkeys</ref> and <ref target="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03333758" type="new-window-url">African elephants</ref>.

After finishing his song, Arion jumped into the sea, but a dolphin carried him safely to Taenarum.

For divers of them [i.e. many beasts] will remember a benefit long after they [have] received it” (<bibl><ref target="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A21287.0001.001/1:6.13?rgn=div2;view=fulltext" type="new-window-url"><title rend="italic">The book named the Governor, devised by sir Thomas Elyot knight</title></ref> [London: Thomas Berthelet, 1537], fols. 152r–v, with modernized spelling and punctuation</bibl>). For nonhuman beasts, loyalty to one’s “interests” may therefore result in excessive loyalty to humans, and even in animal suffering. Thus Elyot relates a series of anecdotes demonstrating the extreme loyalty of dogs (some dating back to Pliny), including those that refused to eat after their masters had died (152v–153r). Similarly, many of the stories that Pulter references in “The Dolphin” end poorly for the dolphins involved (see notes for “Arion” and “two pretty boys”).</note></seg>, <seg>himself his friend<note type="gloss">i.e. the dolphin is friend to ungrateful man</note></seg>.</rdg>
