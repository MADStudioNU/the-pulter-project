                        The aim of the elemental edition to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers,
                        which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and
                        punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might
                        otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not
                        modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote
                        aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by
                        Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to
                        allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various
                        possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure
                        material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford
                        Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s
                        edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The
                        result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.

The retention of original spelling and punctuation has the potential to get us closer to the choices made by the poet and scribe, but some scribal details (such as abbreviations) do not seem substantive or meaning-bearing and run the risk of alienating a modern reader.</note></rdg>

                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">While the poem is framed as the speaker’s injunction to her soul to follow the model of the morning lark (by rejoicing and praising God in song), the gruesome anecdote that she tells about the fate of the lark converts the poem into a story about how to look past the suffering of the mortal world and fixate on eternal heaven. As she does in many other poems, Pulter focuses on nonhuman agents—such as animals and plants—to create spiritual allegories. In the speaker’s lesson to her soul, she tells the tragic story of how the lark secreted her nest by a beautiful river, whose bubbling sound might train her babies to sing. A rustic worker, however, mows down the grass and dismembers her larks. He takes the one surviving baby lark home to his son, who kills it by playing with it. The poem thus suggests the need to overcome grief about the loss of loved ones, advice particularly appropriate for Pulter, who lost thirteen children.</note></rdg>
                <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">
                  <p>In this poem, the speaker depicts a lark praising God through her song, which reminds the speaker of her own duty to do the same. But the poem takes a surprising turn in its depictions of violence in the form of a callous mower, death, and maternal suffering. The lark is one of several female figures in the poem, including the poet, who expresses her grief through song. Pulter has written several poems which reference the deaths of her children, such as “Upon the Death of my Dear and Lovely Daughter, Jane Pulter” (Poem 10), “Tell me no more [On the Same]” (Poem 11), “O, My Afflicted Solitary Soul” (Poem 28), and “The Invocation of the Elements” (Poem 41). She has also used the language of singing to characterize her desire to worship God, while still on earth (as in “Dear God, Turn Not Away Thy Face” [Poem 20], ll. 9-12) and, more frequently, after death in heaven (as in “How Long Shall My Dejected Soul” [Poem 24], ll. 17-24, and “My Soul’s Sole Desire” [Poem 29], ll. 9-15).</p>
                  <p>As James V. Baker notes, unlike the tragic mythological origin of the nightingale (in which the raped and mutilated Philomela is turned into this nocturnal singer), “the lark has had a more joyous history.”<seg>1<note>James V. Baker, “The Lark in English Poetry,” <title rend="italic">Prairie Schooner</title>, vol. 24, number 1 (Spring 1950), pp. 70-79 (p. 70).</note></seg> He provides two famous instances from early modern poetry. The first is Shakespeare’s sonnet 29, which contains the lines, “Yet in those thoughts myself almost despising, / Haply I think on thee, and then my state, / Like to the lark at break of day arising / From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven’s gate” (lines 9-12). In “L’Allegro,” Milton’s speaker wishes “To hear the lark begin his flight, / And singing, startle the dull night, / From his watch-tower in the skies, / Till the dappled dawn doth rise” (lines 41-44). Pulter herself writes of a joyously singing lark in “The Invitation into the Country” (Poem 2): “The early Larke long ere the Morne / with Roses can her head Adorne / Sings Cheerfully a Roundelay / Telling this lower world ’tis day” (ll. 41-44; my transcription from the manuscript). Baker notes of his own observations of the bird, “In flight the lark continually flutters its wings, and mounts higher and higher, till it becomes a mere speck, and sometimes dissolves out of sight, though its song continues to be heard” (p. 70). The constant rising towards heaven while singing fits Pulter’s depiction of the lark, but her singing bird has a much more mournful significance for the female poetic voice. Three poems after “The Larke” in her manuscript, Pulter uses the bird as an image of the fragility of life: “The Spritely Lark how cheerfully Shee Sings / Untill the Hawk her little Neck of[f] wrings” in "My Heart Why Dost Thou Throb So in My Breast?" (Poem 49, ll. 5-6; my transcription from the manuscript). But in “The Larke,” the speaker urges her soul to follow the lark’s example in continuing to worship and contemplate heaven in spite of her suffering.</p>

Harmless sheep are annoyed by Pulter’s spider, but Topsell claims that a specific kind of long-legged spider lives in the fields and “delight[s] in the company of Sheepe: and for this cause I take it, that we Englishmen do call her a Shepheard, either for that she keepeth and loueth to be among their flockes, or because that Shepheardes haue thought those grounds and feedings to bee very holesome wherein they are most found, and that no venomous or hurtfull creature abideth in those fields where they be” (pp. 270-271). Pulter’s spider is gendered female, but Pliny notes in <bibl><title rend="italic">The historie of the world</title> (1634)</bibl> that “Some thinke, it is the female that spins and weaues; and the male, which hunts and gets in the prouision for the familie: thus ordering the matter equally in earning their liuing, as man and wife together in one house” (book 11, chapter 24, p. 324). Pulter’s female spider both weaves a web outside and entraps prey. For a poem on the female house spider and the male spider who hunts outside the home, see Margaret Cavendish’s poem “Of the Spider” in “Curations.”</note></seg></rdg>

Pulter again mentions the idea that larks are trapped in this way in "The Cruel Tiger" (Emblem 15), lines 5-6 (“Soe is the Early Riseing Lark a lass / Onely insnar’d with looking in A Glass”) but in “The Larke” the bird knows of this danger and avoids it.</note></seg></rdg>

Pulter is repeating the sentiment that Dr. John Preston is said to have uttered on his deathbed. Several contemporaries refer to Preston’s words, including Joseph Hall: "It was a gracious speech of a worthy Divine upon his death-bed, now breathing towards heaven, That he should change his place not his company: His conversation was now before hand with his God, and his holy Angels; the only difference was, that he was now going to a more free and full fruition of the Lord of life, in that region of glory above, whom he had truly (though with weaknes and imperfection) injoyed in this vale of tears" (<bibl><title rend="italic">The devout soul, or, Rules of heavenly devotion: also, The free prisoner, or, The comfort of restraint</title> [1650], pp. 18-19</bibl>).</note></seg>.</rdg>
