This is one of three poems that Pulter dated 1647.

Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">In this political-pastoral complaint (in iambic pentameter couplets), the narrator discovers the river Thames mourning the imprisonment of King Charles I in 1647 and the national crisis that has ensued because of the civil war. The use of a frame tale and an embedded narrator was common in Renaissance complaint poems (by William Shakespeare, Samuel Daniel, Thomas Lodge, and others). In this poem, however, Pulter creates a personification of a topographical feature, who testifies to the decline of England and lauds the glory of Charles I and past English rulers (whose erotically-described travel over her waters made her the envy of all the rivers of the world). After inventorying world rivers and mourning the loss of their admiration, the Thames fantasizes that she might stream underground and transport Cromwell and parliamentary authorities to a hellish classical underworld. She then offers to immortalize the king with the only material she can offer: the watery tears of grief.</note></rdg>
                <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">Framed by a brief first-person introduction and conclusion, “The Complaint of Thames” voices the lament of the Thames river, personified as a female figure, for the betrayal of the rightful monarch, King Charles I, by the people and city of London. Pulter examines the political consequences of the king’s imprisonment in both national and global contexts through the device of a catalog of rivers. Drawing upon extensive geographical and historical lore, Pulter heightens the pathos of the Thames’s complaint by putting it into dialogue with the famous rivers of England and the world. The rivers alternately envy the Thames and grieve with her, joined, finally, by the speaker who puts off sleep to weep with the rivers of the world.</note></rdg>

                      <p>Pulter personifies the Thames as a feminized figure, thus drawing on the tradition of complaint poetry such as Samuel Daniel’s “The Complaint of Rosamund” and Spenser’s “The Ruines of Time.” In Spenser’s poem, the speaker stands by the river Thames and overhears the complaint of a woman who speaks as the spirit of Verulamium, an ancient Roman city. Some well known poems, such as Michael Drayton’s <title rend="italic">Poly-Olbion</title>, identified the Thames as masculine. In John Denham’s popular “Cooper’s Hill” (1642), likewise, the Thames is personified as a “son” of the Ocean:</p>

The Thames boasts that the famous rivers of Britain (Severn, Humber, Ouse, and Dee), Europe (Danube, Tagus, Loire, Po, and Tiber), Africa (Nile), Asia (Ganges), and the Middle East (Euphrates) once envied her because she was home to Charles and Henrietta Maria. Pulter draws upon extensive geographical and historical knowledge in her characterization of each river. Each river announces its greatest glory (e.g., the Danube is the longest; Cleopatra traveled on the Nile; the Ganges received sacrifices of its people; the Euphrates bordered Eden), and then admits that it is the Thames that is superior and deserves its “envy.” When the Thames’s fellow rivers learn that the city has betrayed its monarchs, however, they “envy me no more,” and join with the Thames in its mourning (“with their tears my heavy loss deplore”).</note></seg>.</rdg>
