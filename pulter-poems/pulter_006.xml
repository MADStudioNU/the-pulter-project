                        The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers,
                        which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and
                        punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might
                        otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not
                        modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote
                        aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by
                        Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to
                        allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various
                        possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure
                        material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford
                        Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s
                        edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The
                        result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.

                        <p>My priority in editing these poems has been to modernise, and to achieve interpretative and visual clarity, in order to make the poems as accessible as possible to as wide a modern audience as is possible. Spelling is modernised, as is punctuation. Modernising the latter, in particular, often involves a significant act of editorial interpretation, but in my view this is one of the most productive areas of editorial intervention, particularly for a manuscript text such as Pulter’s where the punctuation is erratic compared to modern usage (and, indeed, compared to early modern printed texts).<seg>1<note type="critical">1.

                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">In this devotional poem, the speaker instructs her soul not to lament mortality, but to accept the eventual decay and dissolution of everything: nature, poetic fame, political power, youth, beauty, animals, civilizations, the earth, planets, and stars. In detailing how all natural and cosmological elements in the world will revert back to their “first principles” or original “cause” in the grand cycle of life, the poem provides an extensive catalogue of specific trees, plants, animals, mythological characters, ancient cities, constellations, and planets. As the title suggests, this self-reprimand—or, perhaps, self-consolation—is prompted by an illness connected with the speaker’s fifteenth pregnancy, and it does not conclude, as do many of her poems, with an affirmation of the afterlife. It seems instead focussed on the scope and scale of the unmaking of the physical world.</note></rdg>
                <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">
                    <p>Pulter’s detailed title to this occasional poem indicates its context and focus. Seriously ill during her pregnancy with her fifteenth child, her son John, she addresses her own soul, fearful at the possibility of death, and reassures it by outlining the universality of “dissolution”, the death of the mortal body. Her poem progresses through an extended series of similes, comparing the end of “mortal man” to that of all other creatures and elemental things; these similes owe much to the emblematic mode of thinking that is evident in the emblem poem series later in the manuscript. For another poem written in illness during this pregnancy, see "This Was Written in 1648, When I Lay in, with my Son John" (Poem 45); and see discussion in <bibl>Alice Eardley (ed.), <title rend="italic">Lady Hester Pulter: Poems, Emblems, and The Unfortunate Florinda</title> (Toronto: Iter Inc. and Centre for Reformation and Restoration Studies, 2014), p. 16.</bibl></p>
                    <p>Like many of Pulter’s poems, “Universal Dissolution” is related to the mode of devotional complaint, in which the distressed, earthbound soul articulates its worldly grief and its yearning to be with God. Pulter’s manuscript contains several devotional complaints, such as "Must I Thus Ever Interdicted Be" (Poem 55). “Universal Dissolution”, however, is typical of many of Pulter’s other devotional poems in that it is not a complaint per se, but is cast as a response to the implicitly prior plaints of her own heart and soul. Thus the poem opens "My soul, why art thou sad ...?" The poem outlines a philosophical consolation for her heart and soul, illustrating through multiple examples that “all sublunary things decay” (line 108), and concluding “Then my unsettled soul be more resolved, / Seeing all this universe must be dissolved.” This stance exemplifies the devotional stoicism typical of Pulter’s poems, even as they articulate significant physical, personal, and political hardships and melancholy.</p>
                  <p>This poem contains a number of amendments in three of the main hands present in the manuscript: the scribal hand, the hand likely to be Pulter’s own, and the “antiquarian hand” (see Ross (2000), pp. 150-171 and 252-4). For this reason, the poem makes an excellent case study in the editing processes evident in the manuscript. Only substantive amendments and editorial choices are outlined in the notes below.</p>
