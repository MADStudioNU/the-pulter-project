            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

            <note type="editorialnote">Our priority in editing these poems has been to modernise, and to achieve interpretative and visual clarity, in order to make the poems as accessible as possible to as wide a modern audience as is possible. Spelling is modernised, as is punctuation. Modernising the latter, in particular, often involves a significant act of editorial interpretation, but in our view this is one of the most productive areas of editorial intervention, particularly for a manuscript text such as Pulter’s where the punctuation is erratic compared to modern usage (and, indeed, compared to early modern printed texts). <seg>1<note>1.

              <note type="headnote">Pulter’s first emblem canvasses the vain ambition of the builder of the biblical Tower of Babel, who famously sought by “terrestrial towers” to attain the heights of “super-celestial bowers”; she then associates this biblical parable with the Greek myth of the giants who similarly overreached in seeking heaven. But how different, really, was Pulter’s ambitious poetic project? Even as she lambasted Nimrod, might she have seen herself as “foolishly dreaming” that her own “mortal sight / Could view invisible, inaccessible light”? It seems so, since this poem eventually takes a sharp turn away from cursing the presumption of Nimrod and other pre-Christian usurpers—in what might well have been a glance at rebels against the English throne—to a self-abasing prayer for preservation against being found in their company. What she hopes might save her from that fate is her adherence to Christ’s alternative spiritual architecture: not a monolithic tower, but more modest “steps.”</note>

            <note type="headnote">
                <p>This is the first poem in Pulter’s emblem series titled “The Sighs of a Sad Soul Emblematically Breathed Forth by the Noble Hadassah”. Comprised of fifty-three emblems, this poetic project constitutes a unique contribution to the tradition of English emblem poems, as Pulter revises the traditional tripartite format of the emblem, consisting of <foreign rend="italic">inscriptio</foreign> (a motto), <foreign rend="italic">pictura</foreign> (visual image), and <foreign rend="italic">subscriptio</foreign> (a short epigrammatic verse). Pulter removes the visual image (<foreign rend="italic">pictura</foreign>) to form what are known as “naked” emblems, in doing so placing the emphasis on the visual qualities of her writing (Alice Eardley, <title rend="italic">Poems, Emblems, and The Unfortunate Florinda / Lady Hester Pulter</title> [Toronto; Iter and Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies, 2014], 28). By utilising the didactic affordances of the emblem genre, Pulter continues to address the personal and political concerns of her earlier occasional and devotional lyrics, attending to her experiences as a woman, mother, and royalist during the 1650s, in which the poems are believed to have been written.</p>
                <p>Pulter begins her emblem collection here by asserting a political persona in contrast with the biblical Nimrod, the infamous conspirator behind the construction of the Tower of Babel. Nimrod’s ambitious project resulted in the division of language, God’s punishment for the vain aspirations which possessed Nimrod to seek beyond the “supercelestial bowers” of Heaven (line 8). Likening this to the gigantomachy (struggle between the gods and giants) detailed in Ovid’s <title rend="italic">Metamorphoses</title>, in which the earthly giants similarly sought a heavenly position, Pulter compares the ambition of  the giants and Nimrod. She invokes the suggestion of Ovid’s English translator, George Sandys, that in each story, their ambition results merely in confusion, “one [being] confounded with lighting, and the other by the confusion of languages” (George Sandys, <title rend="italic">Ovid’s Metamorphoses Englished</title> [New York: Garland, 1976], 27).</p>
                <p>Pulter’s first emblem embodies the strongly visual evocations of “naked” emblems, while its account of vain impious ambition suggests the politicised role the collection will proceed to take in its criticism of the current political landscape in England, as the “usurping Nimrods” (line 18) here pertain to the republican parliamentarians (Eardley 28). Pulter elicits an image of humble godly steps to contrast with the Tower of Babel’s “huge fabric” (line 2), imparting to her readers that, by following in God’s footsteps – namely the steps of virtue that are then presented in Pulter’s second emblem – one can be “preserve[d]” from this ambitious folly (lines 2, 21). This message, confirmed in the final two couplets via Pulter’s own turn inward to a meditational prayer, encompasses the direction her following fifty-two emblems will take, as Pulter explores her own relationship to God in relation to the political and personal contexts emerging out of the Civil War. Thus, this emblem establishes her poetic devotion as a political response to the events of the 1650s, as she establishes a moral superiority throughout the collection as a model for her readers to follow.</p>

God punished this ambitious action by replacing the ubiquitous language of all people on Earth with multiple languages, halting the construction of the Tower by destroying the ability to communicate. Note that in her account, Pulter diverges from the Bible’s emphasis from the collective aim of the Babylonian people, focusing on Nimrod as the sole perpetrator of this ambitious desire. See Gen. 10–11. See also Paradise Lost 12.24–78 for Milton’s description of Nimrod’s “proud ambitious heart”. Sarah Ross compares these two depictions in “‘This Kingdoms Loss’: Hester Pulter’s Elegies and Emblems” (in <title rend="italic">Women, Poetry, and Politics in Seventeenth-Century Britain</title> [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015], 135–73 [160]).</note></seg>, hunting after fame,</rdg>

God is described as “dwelling in unapproachable light” in which “no man has ever seen or ever can see him” (1 Tim. 16). See the invocation at the opening of Milton’s <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title>, Book 3, where he appeals for a “celestial Light” to shine inwards so he “may see and tell / Of things invisible to mortal sight” (3.51–5). Aemilia Lanyer also uses the topos in <title rend="italic">Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum</title>, exhorting that “in these Lines I may no further stray, / Than his most holy Spirit shall giue me Light: / That blindest Weakenesse be not over-bold” (Susanne Woods [ed.], <title rend="italic">Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum</title> [New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993], lines 301–304).</note></seg></rdg>

Pulter’s following lines retell Jove’s “tear[ing]” down of these mountains “with thunder” (see note to line 13). Pulter compares the actions of Nimrod to those of the giants (see Headnote); this comparison fuses and reconciles classical and biblical sources to confirm the lesson of the poem regarding impious ambition.

Pulter warns that Nemesis, goddess of retribution, “will look down / On all usurpers”, and concludes that “all confusion from ambition springs,” so “’Tis best for everyone to keep his sphere” (lines 19–20, 40, 43).</note></seg> Nimrods have their due,</rdg>

In each line, one thing begets another version of and return for itself, which is in keeping with the poem’s general investment in substituting one condition for another (Christ’s for Nimrod’s). Yet these lines could be punctuated differently. If read “Let their accurséd plots prove their delusion / For fancied glory; let them find confusion,” the reader understands the object of delusion (“glory”) and experiences the rhetorically powerful command in the prayer: “let them find confusion.” At this time, “confusion” meant not only mental discomfort but also ruin, destruction, and perdition.</note></seg></rdg>

            <rdg wit="#ae"><seg>But from presumption, Lord, preserve my soul,<note type="critical">Pulter’s emblem concludes with self-reflection, turning inwards as opposed to expanding outwards to encompass the audience in a larger moral truth. She addresses God in direct colloquy, asking Him to “preserve” her soul from “presumption”. Rachel Dunn writes that the effect of this is a “psalmic inwardness” which contrasts with the traditional emblem’s “exegetical unfolding” (“Breaking a Tradition: Hester Pulter and the English Emblem Book”, <title rend="italic">The Seventeenth Century</title>, 30.1 [2015], 64). This is a notable contrast from Milton’s appeal in <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title>, a text which, although certainly not an emblem itself, draws on the emblematic quality of seeking to unfold a greater truth to readers, encouraging their spiritual edification (Dunn 63–4). For comparison with Milton, see also note to “dim mortal sight”.</note></seg></rdg>

It also refers directly to the next (second) emblem’s listing of virtues, which culminate a similar image of godly steps. The image of climbing stairs also resonates with her “stairs of revolution”, an idea she associates in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="48">Immense Fount of Truth</ref> with the transformation of body and soul after death (line 6).</note></seg></rdg>
