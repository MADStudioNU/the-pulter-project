                        <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

                        <note type="headnote">In this brief poem, death is bid both welcome and farewell, as if in mimicry of its transient power in Pulter’s cosmology. Even the speaker’s easy personification and colloquial diction in the opening lines helps downgrade death as a threat. The speaker’s problem, indeed, is that she <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> die: which is her fault, since a tender heart would have broken already (presumably from the grief she mentions more than once here, as in other poems alluding to the passing of Pulter’s political heroes and children). But her heart is hard, or “petrified,” a word which in Pulter’s time meant not scared but turned to stone. This image might suggest the speaker’s unfitness as a Christian; what is almost as bad, though, is that such hardness of heart has paradoxically protected her from an otherwise lethal grief: that is, grieving others’ deaths has delayed her own. But in this poem, the speaker seizes the opportunity to turn away from the past and toward her desired death–and with it, presumably, the equally desired end of the grief that forestalled her death until now.</note>

                        <note type="headnote"><p>Poem 19 is the first of two poems titled “The Welcom(e)”. (See also <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="33">The Welcome [2]</ref>.) In both poems, the speaker welcomes death; but, in Poem 19, the irregular rhyme schemes and inharmonic cadences suggest how uneasy and contradictory the speaker’s thinking about death actually is. </p>
                            <p>The poem opens with the speaker offering her soul to personified Death, only to turn immediately from her at the start of the second line and listen to the tolling bell, which presumably marks the speaker’s impending death and asks that listeners pray for her departing soul. The speaker’s calling the bell “sweet” is ironic: early modern and modern European bells have a characteristic minor overtone, which gives them an inherently melancholic sound. The irony is doubled in this line’s echo of John Donne’s <title rend="italic">Devotions</title> (1624). By asking “is it not for mee the bell doth toll?”, the speaker does what Donne says not to do: “Any Mans <hi rend="italic">death</hi> diminishes <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, because I am inuolued in <hi rend="italic">Mankinde</hi>; And therefore neuer send to know for whom the <hi rend="italic">bell</hi> tolls; It tolls for <hi rend="italic">thee</hi>.” Nevertheless, her leading question implies that she arrives at the same conclusion as Donne: the bell tolls for her, metaphorically if not literally.</p>
                            <p>The speaker then asks the reader to “trust” her—someone who has just revealed herself to be uncertain, asking questions without clear answers. She characterizes death as merely a brief and uneventful physiological experience (“a sigh and turning up the eye”) and a somewhat sad social occasion (“a few sad farewels to our freinds”). She claims that, for the tender-hearted on her deathbed, the grief of saying goodbye to her friends is enough to break her heart. But instead of breaking the speaker’s heart, grief has hardened it to stone, and so she finds herself simultaneously not fully alive and unable to die.</p>
                            <p>In l. 10, the speaker turns her attention again, this time to address her soul. The speaker treats her body and her soul as different entities, at odds with each other: her soul is imprisoned within her body. After her body dies, her soul will live in heaven. In looking forward to her soul’s saying “Adue” to Death, the speaker anticipates not the “sad farewell” she claimed in l. 6, but a happy end to Death’s recurring visits and a new beginning in the afterlife. </p>
                            <p>Several of Pulter’s poems have the speaker addressing Death, which, though not usually given a gender, is sometimes described with masculine or feminine pronouns, as in “The Welcome” [1]. In early modern European art and literature, personified Death was depicted interchangeably with masculine and feminine features (ex. having a beard or breasts), sometimes in the same work<seg>1<note type="gloss">See, for instance, the Basel Dance of Death (ca. 1440), in which Death is presented in many forms and gendered with both feminine and masculine features. For more on the gendering of personified Death, see Karl S. Guthke’s <title rend="italic">The Gender of Death: A Cultural History in Art and Literature</title> (1999) and Diana Burton’s “The Gender of Death” in <title rend="italic">Personification in The Greek World: From Antiquity to Byzantium</title> (2005).</note></seg>. The speaker’s description of Death as feminine is thus not exceptional. But Death in this poem is unusually social: she travels with her retinue, unlike the lone image of Death that was and remains common. The speaker’s death is likewise a social activity, involving parallel goodbyes to her friends in life and her friend in Death.</p>
                            <p>Pulter’s Death diverges from her contemporaries’ Death in several other ways. Donne’s Death in “Death be not proud” is opportunistic and engaged in a power struggle: he is a “slave to Fate, chance, kings, and desperate men” and dwells with “poyson, warre, and sicknesse.” Herbert’s Death in “Death” is highly material, “[n]othing but bones” until Christ’s “death did put some bloud / Into thy face”. As Herbert’s speaker finds beauty in death, Pulter’s speaker finds freedom from the confines of life. Whereas, in Donne’s and Herbert’s poems, death is transformed by Christ’s sacrifice—bringing new life, it is no longer something to be feared—in Pulter’s poem a nuanced struggle unfolds between one’s spiritual beliefs about death and its material realities: death is a release only for the redeemed Christian soul. </p>

By posing the statement that the bell sounds sweet as a question, the speaker underscores its ironic description and highlights her uncertainty. Leah Knight’s and Wendy Wall’s Elemental Edition punctuates this phrase with an exclamation mark although the manuscript has a question mark. While the syntax is indeed typical of an exclamatory statement, it is nevertheless possible to retain the original punctuation without disrupting the internal coherence of the poem: questions in English are usually formed with the verb “to do” (i.e., “how sweet does it sound?” or “does it sound sweet?”) but they can also be formed simply by adding a question mark to a statement, with a change of intonation. The effect of this is usually to undermine the equivalent statement by expressing surprise or doubt. “How sweet it sounds?” can therefore be read as a surprised or doubtful response to an implied statement “How sweet it sounds!” This sense of surprise or doubt is perhaps caused by the contrast between the sound of a bell ringing for death and the idea of its sounding sweet. This seeming contradiction is then reinforced by the following “trust mee”.

                    <rdg wit="#ae">And bee <seg>involv’d<note type="critical">Words with an “ed” ending, such as “involved”, can be pronounced in multiple ways: emphasizing the “ed” (i.e., in-volv-èd), which adds an additional syllable to the word, or not emphasizing the “ed” (i.e., in-volv’d); these alternate pronunciations are convenient for writing in pentameter. While the convention in early modern English poetry is to syllabize the “ed” ending when it is written as such (i.e., “involved”) and not when it is written using an apostrophe in place of the “e” (i.e., “involv’d”), poets do not always adhere to this convention. In her Curation <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Manuscript Ambiguities</ref>, Liza Blake argues that Pulter’s manuscript is written in two different hands: Pulter’s own hand and that of her scribe; “The Welcom” (Poem 19) is written in the latter. Both hands are inconsistent in their spellings of past participles. Compare, for instance, “troubled” in line 1 and “involv’d” in line 13: to keep the metre of the lines, both “ed” endings are not pronounced, and yet they are spelled differently.

                    <rdg wit="#ae">Then bid Adue to Death and <seg>her<note type="critical">While in early modern Europe, personified Death was presented as male, female, or neuter, Pulter uses gendered pronouns to refer to Death in only six poems, three of which use the pronoun "she". <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="20">Dear God, Turn Not Away Thy Face</ref> and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="40">My Soul, Why Art Thou Full of Trouble?</ref> also describe Death as feminine.</note></seg> Curst <seg>train<note type="gloss">“A number of people following, accompanying, or attending on a person, usually one of high rank of importance” (OED). It is not clear of what or whom Death’s train is composed. In “Death be not proud,” Donne’s Death dwells “with poyson, warre, and sicknesse.” Death’s train here may likewise be composed of people or of other personifications, perhaps of the grief and pain of the poem’s final line.</note></seg></rdg>
