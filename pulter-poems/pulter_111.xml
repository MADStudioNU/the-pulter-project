          <p>Apparent errors are preserved and editorial corrections provided using SIC and CORR tags, but only where the editor conjectures that the original scribe or compositor would have recognized the instance as an error. For example, what according to modern usage is incorrect subject/verb agreement might have been deemed acceptable to a seventeenth-century scribe or compositor. All such instances are treated instead using the ORIG and REG tags. (See below.)</p>
          <p>Corrections and annotations made within the scope of the original document either by its original authors, owners, and/or transcribers are noted using ADD tags. These annotations and may be further explained within NOTE tags, as added by the editors of this digital edition, for display within the apparatus.</p>

          <p>Original spellings, abbreviations, and orthography are preserved.

            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

          <rdg wit="#ee">
            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

          <rdg wit="#ee">
              <note type="headnote">Is it possible to flee from punishment for your sins? In this emblem, Pulter fuses two of her favorite themes: the danger of underestimating even the seemingly slightest adversaries (which she commonly typifies by mice, rats, flies, and lice), and the karma-like cycling of the material and spiritual world. Here, Pulter spins these twin arguments out of the folk legend associated with the Mouse Tower in Germany (which echoes the Polish legend of Popiel). The story tells of how the tyrant Hatto, who cruelly denounced peasants as the true vermin of the earth and burned them to death, was then the subject of God’s revenge by literal vermin who chased him to a tower in a river and ate him alive. After describing other famous figures who gruesomely choked on flies or whose bodies were ridden with lice, Pulter unearths the possible silver lining of a world where you can never hide from God’s judgment: the divine will always be able to pierce the worst darkness to offer mercy and comfort. The phantasmagoric fate of being eaten alive by mice prompts Pulter’s resolve to accept the world’s endless cycles: “For should I take Aurora’s golden wings,” she exclaims, in imagining trying to escape the world, “And fly her shining circle, still it brings / Me whence I came.” The frightening prospect of “what goes around comes around” converts, in the end, into an embrace of the inevitable return to divinely mandated origins.</note>
