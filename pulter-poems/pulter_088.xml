            Apparent errors are preserved and editorial corrections provided using SIC and CORR tags, but only where the editor conjectures that the original scribe or compositor would have recognized the instance as an error. For example, what according to modern usage is incorrect subject/verb agreement might have been deemed acceptable to a seventeenth-century scribe or compositor. All such instances are treated instead using the ORIG and REG tags. (See below.)

          <rdg wit="#ft"><note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/l/transcript-conventions">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note></rdg>
          <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/l/elemental-conventions">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>
          <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="editorialnote">Our “amplified” editions seek to make the poems as accessible as possible by modernizing spelling and punctuation and providing only brief definitions for words, while discursive notes and the materials we gather for the “curations” section place Pulter’s poems into conversations. Then we use the notes and the materials we gather for the “curations” section to place Pulter’s poems into conversations. As we build the curations for a given poem—provisional and quirky as they are—we keep returning to the poem, re-reading, rethinking, and adding layers to the notes. We hope to show that Pulter was intellectually and politically embedded rather than isolated, taking up issues, genres, and tropes that also interested her contemporaries and that sometimes accrue unpredictable salience in later periods. Rather than focusing only on possible sources or influences, we cast a wide net both within the seventeenth century and outside it, trying to catch cultural materials Pulter might have engaged, some she excludes or ignores, and even some she probably could never have imagined, but that might stir readers today to make new connections (to Harry Potter, for instance). In other words, our curations don’t precede the poems nor are they implied by the poems—as if the poem gathers them to itself (although it can sometimes feel that way) or hales them forth. Instead, as curators we weave the poem into a web of relations, seeking to open out rather than close down interpretive possibilities.</note></rdg>

        <app type="headnote">
          <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">How is a poisonous toad like a jousting knight? Not much, one might think; but by the end of Pulter’s poem, both are rendered emblematic of the false trust people put in “worldly vanities.” The poem accomplishes this analogy through a roundabout account likening a conflict between two lowly creatures to the type of embroilment more typical of courtly gallants. But as well as critiquing those who pick their battles poorly, Pulter points a finger at the fans of such fights: while the toad and spider, like the poem’s carpet knight, might seem to duke it out in “single duel,” an entire “multitude” eggs on the beasts in this fable, just as a fickle lady-love contributes to the jouster’s fall from grace. In Pulter’s <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="7">On those Two Unparalleled Friends, Sir George Lisle and Sir Charles Lucas, Who Were Shot to Death at Colchester</ref>, a Hydra-headed multitude is lambasted for fomenting England’s civil wars, while high-ranking individuals are ennobled for their role in the same; here, in contrast, Pulter levels the battlefield, suggesting war’s futility for all, herself included (as the concluding couplet shows).</note></rdg>
          <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">One of a set of poison-duel poems (the other of which is <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="72">Two Mountebanks (Emblem 6)</ref>), “The Toad and Spider” touches on historical power contests over regal authority in order to critique courtiers’ obsession with short-lived success in court politics and women’s changing affections, forms of fame as easily uprooted as the toad’s plantain. Whereas “Two Mountebanks” can be read as a commentary upon the early modern contests over medical authority, “The Toad and Spider” goes one step further to critique the transient nature of any kind of earthly reputation. The duel between the toad and spider was a fairly common image and often paired with accounts of court intrigue (see Browne, Topsell, and “The History of the Second Death of the Rump” ballad in “Curations”), but Pulter seems to be unique in reaching back into Plantagenet history. Both duels center around charges of treason and the combatants’ concern with reputation: Shakespeare’s account of the duel in <title rend="italic">Richard II</title> records that Mowbray and Bolingbroke disregard the king’s call for peace and insist on a duel to preserve their honor and good name. But just as the toad’s poison vanishes when the spectators remove the plantain, Bolingbroke and Mowbray’s titles and good names vanish when they incur the displeasure of the king. Pulter makes a comparison to courtiers chasing the favor of their ladies and monarchs, suggesting that “t’influence of a lady’s eye,” like the toad’s plantain, can easily be removed and thus does not serve as a stable basis for one’s reputation. While it is possible to read this poem as a critique of the excesses and ephemerality of court politics, Pulter, whose poems primarily espouse royalist views, stops short of critiquing the monarchy itself. She sidesteps the issue of monarchy’s hollow power and instead re-focuses on faith as a way to secure lasting reputation. In doing so, she scorns the various accessories and pastimes of the nobility: tournaments, courtly behavior, flirtation, plays, bird-keeping, and card-playing.</note></rdg>

Perhaps she remembers here seeing a tournament before James I and his wife Anne—or someone else’s account of one. Hugely popular during Queen Elizabeth’s reign, ceremonial tournaments gradually fell out of favor and appear to have been out of fashion by the reign of Charles I and his queen, Henrietta Maria.</note></seg>.</rdg>

See <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="72">Two Mountebanks (Emblem 6)</ref>, for a similar crux with “feild,” which may be interpreted as “affected by touch; felled, as made to fall; foiled; failed; fielded, as in battled.”</note></seg>, made his <seg>address<note type="critical">See <ref type="pp-curation-ref" target="/poems/ee/two-mountebanks-emblem-6/#what-is-a-mountebank">What Is a Mountebank?</ref> in the Curations for <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="72">Two Mountebanks (Emblem 6)</ref> for materials on the etymology of “toady,” a synonym for a sycophant or parasite, which dates back to the practices of early modern mountebanks.</note></seg></rdg>

However, in the sixteenth century, the term quickly became derogatory: John Ferne writes in his 1586 <title rend="italic">Blazon of Gentrie</title> that “A Knight … may be dubbed … in the time of peace upon the carpet … he is called a knight of the carpet, because that the King sitteth in his regal chair of estate and the gentleman … kneeleth before his sovereign upon the carpet or cloth usually spread … for the sovereign’s footstool (105).” Carpet-Knight, then, came to be used as a term of contempt for a knight whose successes were in a lady’s carpeted chamber, with all its accompanying innuendo.</note></seg>.</rdg>
