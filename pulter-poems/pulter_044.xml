                        The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers,
                        which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and
                        punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might
                        otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not
                        modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote
                        aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by
                        Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to
                        allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various
                        possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure
                        material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford
                        Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s
                        edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The
                        result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.

                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">Does sunrise inspire joy? Or is it a sorrowful reminder that earthbound humans hope to glimpse a heaven that remains frustratingly out of reach, entrapping them in cycles of darkness and light? In this poem, the speaker shifts abruptly in her assessment, as she alternately commands her soul to rejoice at the empowering beauty of dawning light and scolds herself for forgetting the futility of such mortal indulgences. Seeing the dawn awakens contradictory feelings; as the speaker declares, the sun “dazzles mine eyes and doth my spirit damp.” The poem invites the reader to experience some of these ephemeral pleasures through its evocative language: we are witness to Apollo’s sensual embrace of the ocean, as he dips his heat into her cooling waves; to rural girls gathering dew as a beauty-aid in pastoral flirtation; to sunflowers bursting from the earth to court the sun; and even to the conjugal bliss of Pulter’s early marriage, imagined as the strains of musical harmony. However, the planets’ motions—such as the sun rising—also point to human dependence on astrological influence and a fallen world. Pulter’s neologism, “debreathe,” bespeaks the horror of a final earthly ending shorn of the hope of continued breath in eternity. Having alternated between these poles of despair and pleasure, the poem ends with the speaker confirming her faith in a bodily resurrection that will inaugurate proper vision of the Son’s rising and her promise to “exhale” praise (like this poem) while waiting for Judgment Day.</note></rdg>
                <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">In this long, meditative poem, Pulter’s speaker interrogates her own spiritual condition (“my pensive soul”), using the imagery of light and darkness that is so prevalent in her poetry. The poem poses the question: how can I be sad when the natural beauty of the dawn vanquishes the darkness every single day? And, the poem also asks, “what comfort’s in this light / That is alternately pursued by night?” These opposing interpretations of the same situation—light is followed by darkness; darkness is followed by light—are at the center of this poem’s anguished and, finally, hopeful interrogation of its speaker’s spiritual condition. By comparing herself to the personified and anthropomorphized figure of the <foreign rend="italic">solsequium</foreign>, or sunflower, Pulter’s speaker questions whether observation of the natural world can provide a kind of comfort that is analogous to God’s grace.</note></rdg>

                      <p>May-dew is prized for its cosmetic and medicinal properties. In <title rend="italic">Irelands Natural History</title>, Gerard Boate explains how to gather it:</p>
                        <cit>
                          <quote>“The English women, and Gentlewomen in Ireland, as in England, did use in the beginning of the Summer to gather good store of Dew, to keep it by them all year for several good uses both of physick and otherwise, wherein by experience they have learnt it to be very available. Their manner of collecting and keeping it was this. In the moneth of May especially, and also in part of the moneth of June, they would go forth betimes in the morning, and before Sun-rising, into a green field, and there either with their hands strike off the Dew from the tops of the herbs into a dish, or else throwing clean linen clothes upon the ground, take off the Dew from the herbs into them, and afterwards wring it out into dishes.”</quote>
                          <bibl>Gerarde Boate, <title rend="italic">Irelands Natural History</title>, London, 1652, pp. 170-71.</bibl>
                        </cit>
                        <p>Dew might be gathered from many different plants, but Boate explains that dew from “green corn, especially Wheat” has “more vertues” (171).</p>

                      <p>Pulter suggests that one consequence of the Fall is her lack of harmony with the universe, particularly the stars and planets. In a state of innocence, “no sun nor moon” could hurt her, and, further, the heavenly bodies would be “fellows” and a source of “delight.” This claim may refer to legends about how the Fall transformed the physical environment and subjected humans to physical suffering, as well as to debates about how the Fall limits humans’ ability to know both their physical environment and God. Compare Milton’s <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title>, which engages with both traditions. In Book 11, the angels change the orientation of the Earth so that heat of the Sun is intensified and in order to create potentially harmful astrological influences (see 11. 649-78).
