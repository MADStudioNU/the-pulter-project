While many poems about dead children focused on infants and youngsters (see <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">The Death of a Child</ref> in Curations), especially since child mortality was relatively high in the seventeenth century, Pulter here grapples with the loss of a young adult, her daughter Jane, who died in 1645. At 20, Jane was considerably older than Hester was when she married. She had survived the dangers of childhood only to die as she had reached maturity. Pulter had 15 children, the last in 1648, so she might well have been pregnant or nursing when Jane died (see the story of Elizabeth Cary sitting at the deathbed of her daughter and contemplating nursing her daughter’s newborn as well as her own youngest child in “The Death of a Child” in Curations.)</note></seg></rdg>

                    <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/l/elemental-conventions">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>
                    <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="editorialnote">My “amplified” editions seek to make the poems as accessible as possible by modernizing spelling and punctuation and providing only brief definitions for words, while discursive notes and the materials I gather for the “curations” section place Pulter’s poems into conversations. As I build the curations for a given poem—provisional and quirky as they are—I keep returning to the poem, re-reading, rethinking, and adding layers to the notes. I hope to show that Pulter was intellectually and politically embedded rather than isolated, taking up issues, genres, and tropes that also interested her contemporaries and that sometimes accrue unpredictable salience in later periods. Rather than focusing only on possible sources or influences, I cast a wide net both within the seventeenth century and outside it, trying to catch cultural materials Pulter might have engaged, some she excludes or ignores, and even some she probably could never have imagined. Curations don’t precede the poems nor are they implied by the poems—as if the poem gathers them to itself (although it can sometimes feel that way) or hales them forth. Instead, as a curator I weave the poem into a web of relations, seeking to open out rather than close down interpretive possibilities. This extends to including extracts that are long enough that readers might find things therein that I do not anticipate. I also look for a multi-vectored traffic among Pulter’s poetry and the other materials. What might the materials I’ve gathered help readers see in the poems—or notice is not there? But also, how do the poems bring fresh perspectives into the conversations into which I draw them? The more one reads the poems as participants in wider ranging conversations, the more fascinatingly twisty Pulter appears. Often, I don’t grasp how she upends or comes at conventions aslant until I have mucked about composting my “curations.”</note></rdg>

                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">This poem dwells “On the Same” topic as the last, and is thus another elegy for one of the poet’s daughters who died at twenty years of age. The refrain of “Tell me no more” paradoxically enables the sequential canvassing of the very qualities Pulter claims <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to want to recall: Jane’s corporeal beauties, portrayed one by beloved one, are succeeded by the more ineffable elements of her mind, soul, voice, and virtue. Toward the poem’s end, the speaker’s attention tugs away from Jane to her own experience of loss, only to be diverted by yet another lost relic of her child. The inexorable return of the refrain acts as a trope for grief—such that the poem’s addressee could be a personified Grief, implored to silence. But the poem also exhibits tension between the speaker’s loving attachment to things of (but then no longer of) this world and what she knows she <hi rend="italic">should</hi> praise, and claims she shall: “praises … world without end, / To Him.” In the meantime, all praises sung are for a young woman whose world has ended.</note></rdg>
                <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">
                  <p>In this poem, Pulter engages a convention that guided poems including “Song” [“Ask Me No More”], which is often attributed to Thomas Carew (although it circulated without attribution in many seventeenth-century manuscripts), as well as various responses to it (see <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Poems in Conversation</ref> in Curations). Her poem particularly resembles a song set to music by William Lawes (“Tell me no more”). In his essay on “Ask Me No More” and responses to it, Scott Nixon argues that the poems in this subgenre take “pleasure in impersonal debate on an abstract topic” (117); Pulter, however, employs this convention for a highly personal debate on a concrete loss. The poem she produces joins an ongoing game of literary imitation and revision even as it is also an expression of wrenching feeling. The convention usually gestures toward an unnamed, unseen interlocutor, whose words are heard only as the speaker tries to shut them out (tell me no more, ask me no more). This is, then, a dialogic convention that irritably attempts to silence dialogue. Shut up, the speaker seems to say. Enough. As is so often true with Pulter’s poetry, in her hands the convention starts to twist, decompose, and regenerate. In this poem, the loquacious and annoying interlocutors, with their intimate knowledge of Jane Pulter’s physical features and their particular effects, suggest a contention among parts of the self, the parts that insistently remember and the part that is trying to take a Christian perspective on death and loss. Who else might these imagined speakers be anyway? Who exactly would remind the bereaved mother that her daughter’s breasts were snowy, let alone that her nose was “even”?</p>
                    <p>Pulter counters the misogyny of some poems in this subgenre, turning resentment away from the female object of observation and toward the fact of loss and the voices that remind the speaker of that loss. Since the poem lists Jane’s attributes and tries to stop doing so, it is both a blazon and an anti-blazon (see Exploration on <ref target="/#hester-pulter-and-english-blazon" type="pp-exploration-ref">Hester Pulter and the Blazon in Early Modern England</ref>). The catalog of Jane’s features stalls in line 20 at her noble mind, which can never be expressed, at least through the metaphors the poem has relied on thus far. While many of the other lines are enjambed, I sense a pause before and after this line, stranding it no matter how it is punctuated. The speaker then attempts to regroup, shifting the focus from Jane’s body to her soul, only to lapse into despair before a turning point at “until” in line 32, leading to “I” and “she/her” merging into “we” who, reunited in heaven, will sing God’s praises (line 34). The vivid memories of Jane, and the pestering voice of the teller inventorying what has been lost, expose the limits of Christian consolation. Perhaps “we” will be reunited in heaven. Nevertheless, “With her I lost most of my joys on earth.” The speaker ends the poem committed to mourning for “her” and deploring her loss until death rejoins them.</p>

                    <rdg wit="#ae">After a <seg>northern winter’s half-year’s night<note type="critical">One look from Jane was like the return of the sun after six months of darkness. Pulter here refers to the idea that “the nations of the southern world” are in darkness six months out of the year while the sun is in the northern hemisphere. During that time, according to Robert Fludd, “the Antartick pole’s cold property” produces snow, frost, ice, and hail, “mortifying the herbs, fruits, and plants, and such like.” But “the Sun at his next visitation of those quarters, which will be in our northern winter,” by virtue of his “dilating and vivifying spirit,” undoes cold and death, melting the ice and snow, and “reviving the spirit of the trees, plants, and herbs, which were almost lifeless through congelation, and renewing their mourning bodies with new green garments, blossoms, and flowers, and lastly, with wholesome fruit” (Robert Fludd, <title rend="italic">Mosaicall Philosophy Grounded Upon the Essential Truth</title> [London, 1659], I.9.108-109). Jane’s glance had this same effect. This description, suggesting that Jane’s absence created winter and her presence spring, also draws on the myth of Ceres and Persephone: when Persephone was with her mother, Ceres, it was spring and summer; when they had to part for Persephone to be with her husband in the underworld, her mother mourned and it was fall and winter.</note></seg>.</rdg>

If this simile usually emphasized how one precious quality sets off another, Pulter instead emphasizes their restorative effect taken together.</note></seg>.</rdg>

                    <rdg wit="#ae">Which all succeeding ages <seg>still perfumes<note type="critical">After the loving descriptions of what Jane looked like, the poem ends by evoking the sense of smell. Her “unblemished fame” is like “fragrant odors, aromatic fumes,” persisting over time; Jane lingers as a scent. Pulter’s attention to smell links her poem to others in this subgenre as well. In “Ask me no more,”  the beloved’s “fragrant bosom” is both the “spicy nest” and the tomb of the phoenix. “On Lesbia” devotes three lines to Lesbia’s “stink,” a stink “left behind” by Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador and so a way of capturing the foul trace of Catholics and Catholicism. In contrast, “On the Same” describes Jane’s aromatic afterlife in terms reminiscent either of perfumes used in embalming or of accounts of the incorruptible bodies (and body parts) of saints and holy people in Catholic tradition. (See the descriptions of nuns’ incorruptible and perfumed bodies in “Curations.”) Like all mortals, Jane was made of earth (l. 35), of the dust (l. 43) to which she has also returned. The description of Jane sometimes hints at how “in the midst of life we are in death” (see <title rend="italic">The Book of Common Prayer</title> “Order for the Burial of the Dead”): her hair shrouded her shoulders (line 3); her body was a casket (line 21). Although in the early modern period “casket” was not used interchangeably with coffin as it is now, it was used to describe a container for holy relics. Like relics, Jane is both dead and, somehow, undecayed.</note></seg>;</rdg>
