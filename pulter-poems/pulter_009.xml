                            The aim of the elemental edition to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers,
                            which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and
                            punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might
                            otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not
                            modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote
                            aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by
                            Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to
                            allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various
                            possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure
                            material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford
                            Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s
                            edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The
                            result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.
