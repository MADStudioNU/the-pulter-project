Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

                        <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="//pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

Thus, the footnotes detail the challenges of reading Pulter’s idiosyncratic grammar and spelling, and offer options for readings, rather than solutions.</p><p>The editor thanks Melissa Auclair, Clarissa Chenovick, Justine DeCamillis, Julia Fine, Leah Knight, Ian Lancashire, Randall McLeod, Bénédicte Miyamoto, Nathan Murray, Timothy P.J.

                        <note type="headnote">As in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="12">The Garden</ref>, Pulter reads in the botanical world a host of otherwise human-seeming concerns with such things as courtship, constancy, and heroism. Here, a female flower offers non-violent resistance to a masculine sun who burns with lust; she does so through the mere yet steady moisture of her tears. The speaker, ironically, is just as desirous as is the sun of the flower’s emblematic equilibrium—and, through excess, just as lacking in what she loves. It thus seems fitting that the lines are frequently hypermetrical, flush with syllables which threaten to overflow the poem’s grounding in iambic pentameter.</note>

                        <note type="headnote"><p>Hester Pulter’s manuscript divides her work into poems (“Poems Breathed Forth by the Noble Hadassas”) and emblems (“The Sighs of a Sad Soul Emblematically Breathed Forth by the Noble Hadassah”). “Upon the Crown Imperiall” (Poem 53) (a reference to the <foreign rend="italic">Corona imperialis</foreign> flower), could have been placed with the emblems, and yet it is not. Like emblems, this poem has a moral; but it is personal.</p><p>In “Upon the Crown Imperiall,” Pulter does not merely recycle contemporaries’ conventions; she refashions them for herself: although “corona” is grammatically feminine in Latin, seventeenth-century English herbals and garden manuals present the crown imperial flower as neuter or masculine;<seg>1<note type="gloss">For examples, see the Curation <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">The Crown Imperial in the Early Modern English Imagination</ref>.</note></seg> Pulter makes it feminine. The flower’s name invites comparison to the imperial crown, a comparison upon which many contemporary writers rely, although Pulter does not. In Ben Jonson’s <hi rend="italic">Loues triumph through Callipolis</hi> (1631) and James Shirley’s <hi rend="italic">The triumph of peace</hi> (1634), the flower appears as “an emblem of royal power able to provide peace and protection.”<seg>2<note type="gloss">Young, 89.</note></seg> Conversely, it figured in anti-royalist critiques, as in George Herbert’s poem “Peace,” in which the speaker “sp[ies] a gallant flower”, and then digs into the dirt to find “a worm devoure what show’d so well.”<seg>3<note type="gloss">Young, 90.</note></seg> While Pulter’s poetry suggests she read Herbert’s work and was familiar with contemporary herbals and garden manuals, she draws an entirely different picture. Pulter’s flower is not just royal, but also feminine, heroic, and stoic.</p><p>The poem’s conceit rests on an intimate connection between the heart and the eyes. The whitish “faire Orient pearles” of “most cleere shining sweet water” (to quote John Gerard’s <hi rend="italic">Herbal</hi>) contained within the flower’s characteristic hanging bells are the “Tears,” the “imergenties” of her sad heart. Rather than openly shed them, the flower holds her tears still in her eyes, hidden from plain view. Phœbus—the classical sun god and god of poetry—“courts” the flower and “essais” (assays, i.e. tests, or tries to seduce her) her with his “burning kisses”; not being heliotropic, the flower does not turn to him. Instead, by hanging her head, she turns away from his kisses and averts her gaze, blocking the route to her heart.</p><p>The connection between her heart and eyes reveals the flower’s uniquely feminine, stoic heroism, in which a delicate and precise balance is struck between feeling profound emotions and expressing them, avoiding excessive emotional display and indulgence. In early modern England, tears were gendered and important but troubling humoral phenomena, especially for women, for whom both crying and not crying could be suspect. By demonstrating quiet crying without shedding tears, the flower has negotiated a modest constancy. The heart is the source of her tears, which “rise” to her eyes; but the heart is also the (etymological) root of <hi rend="italic">courage</hi>.</p><p>The speaker, unlike the flower, is not able to strike this balance and is prone to excess: as Knight and Wall note in the headnote to their Elemental Edition, the poem does not stick to rhyming couplets in iambic pentameter. It includes an odd line<seg>4<note type="gloss">The second line does not appear to belong to a couplet, though it is a near rhyme with the first and third lines.</note></seg> and lines “flush with syllables,” with the exception of the final couplet: “But shee Remains oh that my soul did soe / Ever Brimfull yet never overflow.” Pulter’s manuscript almost entirely lacks punctuation; in their Elemental Edition, Knight and Wall add punctuation to these final two lines: “But she remains; O, that my soul did so, / Ever brimful, yet never overflow.” But these lines might be punctuated differently: “But she remains—O, that my soul did so— / Ever brimful, yet never overflow.” This alternate punctuation makes clearer the speaker’s plaintive desiring of the flower’s virtues for herself and confirms that the flower remains brimful but not overflowing, unlike the speaker who has presumably shed too many tears, a demonstration of emotional excess. Ironically, it is in these final two lines—the only lines that unambiguously adhere to the poem’s implied structure—that the speaker reveals her own lack of emotional restraint. And yet, it is the speaker’s emotional interjection that strikes the balance between restraint and indulgence, equalizing the line with the ‘right’ number of syllables.</p><p>As much of Pulter’s poetry is autobiographical and about her struggles with grief, we are tempted to read the speaker’s voice as Pulter’s own. In such a reading, one might recall that Phœbus is not just the god of the sun, but also the god of poetry, perhaps tempting Pulter to use poetry to stoke, rather than soothe, her grief. In this metaphor, her pen’s ink flows as readily as her tears.</p><p>Bibliography</p><p><bibl>Dunn, Rachel. “Breaking a Tradition: Hester Pulter and the English Emblem Book.” <hi rend="italic">The Seventeenth Century</hi>, 30.1 (2015): 55-73.</bibl></p>

The writings of early modern botanists suggest that the flower was an exciting new import in late-sixteenth-century England but that it had become a “denizen” of English gardens by the time Pulter was writing. The crown imperial flower was therefore popular enough to be recognized by name but was still recognized as being of Eastern origin.</note></seg> eyes</rdg>

                    <rdg wit="#ae">Ever Brimfull yet never <seg>overflow<note type="critical"><p>The concluding “overflow” presents some issues for interpretation. If, as this Amplified Edition offers, “&ff;lower” is the subject of “overflow,” the line should end in “overflows” to be grammatically correct; however, Pulter may have chosen “overflow” for its rhyming with “soe.” If, as in Knight and Wall’s Elemental Edition, “soul” is the subject, then we can take “overflow” as a subjunctive form in a wish (though this would also be grammatically awkward, following “did” in the previous line). “Overflow” might even be read as an adjective that balances “Brimfull”; however, this would have been an exceptional use of the word as there is no instance of “overflow” used as an adjective recorded in the OED, and the OED records the first use of “overflowed” as an adjective in 1671.</p><p>It is also worth noting that, in the Elemental Edition’s reading, the use of the verb “remain” to mean “to continue in the same state” predates the current OED entry, which records its first instance in 1701 and records its use only in recipes, making Pulter’s use of this sense exceptional. However, this Amplified Edition’s reading of the verb “remain” as having the complementing adjectival phrase “ever brimfull” is common and therefore more likely.</p></note></seg>.</rdg>
