                        The aim of the elemental edition to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers,
                        which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and
                        punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might
                        otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not
                        modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote
                        aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by
                        Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to
                        allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various
                        possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure
                        material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford
                        Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s
                        edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The
                        result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.

                    <p>My priority in editing these poems has been to modernise, and to achieve interpretative and visual clarity, in order to make the poems as accessible as possible to as wide a modern audience as is possible. Spelling is modernised, as is punctuation. Modernising the latter, in particular, often involves a significant act of editorial interpretation, but in my view this is one of the most productive areas of editorial intervention, particularly for a manuscript text such as Pulter’s where the punctuation is erratic compared to modern usage (and, indeed, compared to early modern printed texts).<seg>1<note type="critical">1.

                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">In this poetic prayer to God, the speaker seeks illumination of her dark soul, with a promise that in the afterlife the speaker will sing songs of praise to God. The title interestingly claims that her soul renounces all other desires, except the wish to join in the plenitude of heavenly light that the speaker associates with the moment of creation. The poem is self-conscious about its own status as a created work and is markedly experimental in its form: its structure, unusual for Pulter, consists of six three-line stanzas, the first two lines of rhymed iambic pentameter and the third a differently rhymed dimeter, with dimeter lines rhyming in sequential stanzas (AAB CCB and so on). The claim to offer simple adoration—to “my God and king”—is complicated by the intricate structure.</note></rdg>
                <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">
                  <p>This is one of several poems in Pulter’s manuscript articulating her soul’s desire for divine love, and looking beyond the “sad shades” of earthly life to the promise of its continuation “above”. For a close comparison, see <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="55">Must I Thus Ever Interdicted Be</ref>, and see also <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="63">Dear God, from Thy High Throne Look Down</ref>. These devotional lyrics are personal colloquies with God, and they are simple and delicately rendered, of a kind likely to be broadly influenced by the plain style of George Herbert. <bibl><author>Herbert’s</author> <title rend="italic">The Temple</title> (1633)</bibl> was widely read and widely imitated by women writers of devotional verse in the seventeenth century. See extracts from Helen Wilcox, <ref type="pp-curations-ref" target="#ctxs">Entering The Temple</ref> in Curations.</p>
                  <p>The Herbertian qualities of the poem are evident in its combination of apparent simplicity with actual intricacy. It follows a consistent three-line stanza form with a shortened, dimeter, third line, creating an emphasis that serves well the final “My God and king”. These dimeter lines rhyme in pairs across stanzas. Pulter uses the same form (with the slight variation of dimeter lines rhyming in threes across stanzas) in “Dear God, from Thy High Throne Look Down” (Poem 63); and a similar form is used in <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="66">Made When My Spirits Were Sunk Very Low</ref>. In the case of the lyric to hand, the consistent rhyme and meter give a sense of the poem as a song, approximating the “celestial lays” to which the speaker looks forward. These celestial songs are literally “unknown” to her, and so the songs she sings on earth can only ever be poor approximations; however, Pulter’s sense of continuity between her own devotional lyrics and these heavenly lays is intimated in her poem <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="45">This Was Written in 1648</ref>: “I’ll such lays here begin, shall end above” (line 68).</p>
