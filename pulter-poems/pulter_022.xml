                            The aim of the elemental edition to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, 
                            which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and 
                            punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might 
                            otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not 
                            modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote 
                            aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by 
                            Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to 
                            allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various 
                            possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure 
                            material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford 
                            Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s 
                            edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The 
                            result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.

                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">In poetry, lovers often lament daybreak because it disrupts the pleasures afforded by night. Pulter is instead drawn to the beauty, power, and virtue of Aurora (goddess of the dawn), here and throughout the collection. In this poem she uses apostrophe to urge Aurora to unite in military solidarity with the speaker and Aurora’s daughter (Truth) so as to conquer the hellish miseries of conscience unleashed at night. While other Pulter poems dwell on the details of Aurora’s physical appearance, here the speaker merely mentions the beauty of this virginal naked maid who paradoxically has a daughter, Astraea (whom Pulter imagines as Truth, rather than the traditional allegorical association with Justice). The poem is marked by a sudden reflexive moment, when the speaker suddenly doubts her own claims of innocence and uses her soul searching as a more urgent reason for these personified female figures to enlighten the darkness that still exists at the end of the poem.</note></rdg>
                <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote"> “To Aurora [1]” is one of several poems by Pulter about or addressed to Aurora, the goddess of the dawn. The figure of Aurora is important in Pulter’s mythography, appearing as well in "Aletheia’s Pearl" (Poem 32). In “To Aurora [1]” the speaker situates herself between night and day. She implores Aurora to arrive and drive away the Night, which, rather than offering rest, is a time when the speaker is forced to contemplate her sinful state. This poem can be usefully read in the context of the aubade. In the best known English examples of this tradition, such as Donne’s “The Sun Rising” or Juliet’s speech in Act 2 of <bibl><author>Shakespeare’s</author> <title rend="italics"> Romeo and Juliet</title></bibl>, heterosexual lovers desire to arrest the dawn. Pulter’s poem, by contrast, invites Aurora (and her daughter Astraea, the goddess of justice) to join her. These two female figures are the speaker’s “eternal friends,” and she demands that they rescue her from darkness, uncertainty, and doubt.</note></rdg>

Pulter’s speaker promises to “cease these sad complaints” (a phrase which may refer specifically to her invocation of Aurora or more generally to the poetry of the manuscript) if suffering were restricted to the guilty. The speaker’s speculation about guilt and innocence prompts a notable shift in register. The speaker interrupts her apostrophe to Aurora to challenge her own status as speaker with self-reflexive questions (“What do I mean? / For who (alas) can say their heart is clean?”) that trouble the confident invocation of Aurora that begins and ends the poem.</note></seg> and ever hold my peace,</rdg>
