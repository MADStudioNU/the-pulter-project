Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note></rdg>
                    <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

                <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">What do a basilisk, Medusa, and sin have in common? In this emblem grappling with the boundaries between internal and external domains, Pulter explains that each has the power to injure and may only be repulsed by a shield used to mirror back that injury. Blending natural history, mythology, and biblical citation, Pulter weaves a fable explaining the need for Christian faith, conventionally symbolized as a shining shield. Just as Perseus had to use his armor to reflect and return Medusa’s deadly glance, and the reader of the poem (addressed as “you”) must protect against a cockatrice (a legendary serpent able to kill by its “visual beams”), the good Christian must invert evil’s force and return it to its source. Appropriate for a poem about mirroring, the speaker suddenly redirects her gaze, in line 19, back onto herself: rather than teaching the reader a lesson, she shows herself in need of her own instruction. Here she she beseeches God for the power to abort an embryonic sinful temptation before it comes to fruition. Only if this destruction fails will she need the shield of Christ’s sacrifice to enable her to face an externalized Sin.</note></rdg>
                <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote"><p>Pulter’s sixteenth emblem takes up the cockatrice, also known as the basilisk. The emblem focuses on the legendary weakness of the basilisk—it can be destroyed with a mirror that turns its poison back upon itself—in order to explore sin and the defenses humans may (or may not) have against it. Identifying the cockatrice as sin, the poem describes two different methods for defeating it: first, the active discovery of its “deceits” and, second, a reliance on the shield of faith.</p>
                    <p>Consider how this poem functions both as an emblem and also as a performance of the use of emblems. The first eighteen lines of the poem are addressed to an unnamed friend; the repetition of the second-person pronoun “you” suggests that readers should incorporate the lessons of the poem in their own lives.  But in the final seven lines, the speaker intrudes into the poem and tests the applicability of the emblem to her own situation, questioning whether she will “crush” sin or rely upon the shield of faith.</p></note></rdg>

The basilisk is extremely venomous and poisons its victims with its eyes unless the victim uses a glass or mirror to turn the poison back (“reverberates” (line 10)) upon the creature. Sir Thomas Browne reviews, and rejects, much of the lore of the basilisk in Book 3, Chapter 7 of <bibl><title rend="italic">Pseudodoxia Epidemica, or Enquiries into very many received tenets and commonly presumed truths</title> (1646)</bibl>, also known as <title rend="italic">Vulgar Errors</title>. Pulter’s poem participates in the same testing of received knowledge that is the subject of Browne’s popular work, eventually turning the cockatrice into an emblem of the relationship between sin and faith.</note></seg></rdg>
