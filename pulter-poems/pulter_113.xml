All such instances are treated instead using the ORIG and REG tags. (See below.)</p>
          <p>Corrections and annotations made within the scope of the original document either by its original authors, owners, and/or transcribers are noted using ADD tags.

            <note type="editorialnote">In these transcriptions we preserve as many details of the original material, textual, and graphic properties of Hester Pulter’s manuscript verse as we have found practical. Whenever possible, for instance, original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, lineation, insertions, deletions, alterations, spacing between words and lines, and indentation are all maintained; abbreviations and brevigraphs are not expanded; and superscript and subscript representations are retained. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#top" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for the transcriptions here.</ref></note>

            <note type="editorialnote">The aim of the elemental edition is to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers, which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry. <ref target="http://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/about-project-conventions.html#elemental-edition" type="new-window-url">See full conventions for this edition here.</ref></note></rdg>

              <note type="headnote">This poem relates a tale which Pulter’s father may have told about his time as Lord Treasurer to James I. At first, it seems a merely amusing anecdote: a mouse, scampering across a dining table, is caught when an oyster (one of the dishes) snaps shut. The ocean’s changing tides bizarrely affect even the dinner table, stimulating the oyster to snap open and release the mouse. Pulter briefly toys with setting this episode in mock-epic form before treating it, instead, in a more characteristic manner. First, she reads the trapped mouse as emblematic of the sinful soul, temporarily walled up in a fleshly shell. Then, she pins this universal scenario to the particular politics of interregnum England, a time when “a vulgar”—presumably, Oliver Cromwell or his son, Richard—had “rise[n] to reign” in place of the “noble spirit” he “restrain[ed].” That usurped spirit is, first and foremost, Charles I (Pulter’s beloved, imprisoned, then beheaded king), but also her royalist compatriots (among them, many nobles) and indeed herself, since she frequently railed against confinement. In the end, the tidal metaphor offers a kind of comfort, since it suggests we must all, mouse-like, merely wait out any uncomfortable but temporary phase, in politics as in mortality.</note>
