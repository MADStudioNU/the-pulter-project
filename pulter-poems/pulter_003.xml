                        The aim of the elemental edition to make the poems accessible to the largest variety of readers,
                        which involves modernizing spelling and punctuation as well as adding basic glosses. Spelling and
                        punctuation reflect current standard American usage; punctuation highlights syntax which might
                        otherwise be obscure. Outmoded but still familiar word forms (“thou,” “‘tis,” “hold’st”) are not
                        modernized, and we do not modernize grammar when the sense remains legible. After a brief headnote
                        aimed at offering a “way in” to the poem’s unique qualities and connections with other verse by
                        Pulter or her contemporaries, the edition features a minimum of notes and interpretative framing to
                        allow more immediate engagement with the poem. Glosses clarify synonyms or showcase various
                        possible meanings in Pulter’s time. Other notes identify named people and places or clarify obscure
                        material. We rely (without citation) primarily on the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the Oxford
                        Reference database, and the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. When we rely on Alice Eardley’s
                        edition of Pulter’s work, we cite her text generally (“Eardley”); other sources are cited in full. The
                        result is an edition we consider a springboard for further work on Pulter’s poetry.

The retention of original spelling and punctuation has the potential to get us closer to the choices made by the poet and scribe, but some scribal details (such as abbreviations) do not seem substantive or meaning-bearing and run the risk of alienating a modern reader.</note></rdg>

                    <rdg wit="#ee"><note type="headnote">“Aurora [1]” is the first of several poems so named. Pulter attends often, and often ardently, to this classical figure of the dawn, identified elsewhere in her work as the mother of Astraea: a figure in her turn associated by Pulter primarily with truth, rather than justice, as is more conventional. Here, the speaker’s sensuous admiration of Aurora’s luminous beauty and entourage of feminine powers is interrupted by the amorous, then rapacious, pursuit of dawn by the blazing sun god. This allegory rapidly turns gory, with the god lashing his horses until they rain blood on Earth. When the sun god’s illumination is, inevitably, succeeded by the darkness of Night and her misery-making offspring, the poem’s focus shifts from the astral and mythological to something much more personal. The speaker’s vulnerability to nocturnal terrors makes her long for escape through death—quite paradoxically, since visions of death are among the very terrors she seeks to escape. This paradox suggests one way in which, as she says of her dark and distorted visions, “of my reason, straight they make a rape.” But the speaker, in the end, seizes power back from both darkness and the excesses of the sun when she imagines herself, in death, “far outshin[ing] the day,” and the poem’s classical figuration is reconfigured in praise of a biblical God, in a vein congruent with much of Pulter’s devotional verse.</note></rdg>
                    <rdg wit="#ae"><note type="headnote">Aurora is the female mythological figure that appears most often in Pulter’s poetry. This is the first of five poems Pulter has written about or to Aurora, the Roman goddess of the dawn: <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="3">Aurora [1]</ref>, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="22">To Aurora [1]</ref>, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="26">To Aurora [2]</ref>, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="34">To Aurora [3]</ref>, and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="37">Aurora [2]</ref>. The character Aurora also appears in several other poems, including <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="6">Universal Dissolution</ref>, ll. 109-114, and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="23">To Astraea</ref>, ll. 1-4, where she is depicted as the mother of Truth or Astraea. There are several menacing figures in this first poem on Aurora: the Sun, who violently pursues Aurora; Night, whose children torment the speaker; and Death. The poem charts the period of a day: from a blissful awakening at the hands of Aurora, to a time of destruction caused by the lust and rage of the Sun, to a period of suffering brought about by Night’s offspring. The poem ends in a place beyond time, where the speaker’s death will bring her comfort and where she will delight in praising God.</note></rdg>

                        <rdg wit="#ae">Unto some <seg>Antient Monarchie confusion<note type="critical">The poet may be comparing the menacing sign of blood-red raindrops falling from the sky to a kind of biblical plague such as the frogs, lice, and flies that God brought upon the Pharaoh who would not let the Israelites under Moses go free (Exodus 8). Other examples of God’s punishment upon Pharaoh’s kingdom include cattle killing, boils, pestilence, hail, and fire (Exodus 9), and locusts and darkness (Exodus 10). Additionally, as Alice Eardley notes in her edition, Ovid depicts drops of blood falling from the sky in Book 15 of the <title rend="italic">Metamorphoses</title> <bibl>(Alice Eardley, editor, <title rend="italic">Poems, Emblems, and The Unfortunate Florinda</title> Iter and Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies, 2014, p. 57)</bibl>. The context for these lines is the omens which presage the murder of Julius Caesar, a dire event with political ramifications: “when faire <hi rend="italic">Venus</hi> saw; and saw with all, / Conspiring weapons threat the High-Priests [i.e., Caesar’s] fall; / Her colour fled …  Thus, through all heauen, her Sorrowes vainely speake; / And melt the Gods: who, since they could not breake / The antient Sisters [i.e., the Destinies] adamantine doome, / By sure Ostents [i.e., portents] demonstrate Woes to come … Oft, Meteors through the aire their flames extend: / Oft, drops of blood from purple clouds descend” (George Sandys, translator, <title rend="italic">Ouids Metamorphosis Englished, mythologiz’d, and represented in figures</title>, 1632, pp. 507-508). Pulter’s reference to blood-red drops that also “descend” to Earth picks up on this political suggestion, in its foreshadowing of confusion to a monarchy or dissolution to a monstruous hydra (line 28).</note></seg></rdg>

The Hydra, or monster with many heads which grow back as quickly as they are cut off, was a common symbol of unruly government. Charles I in <title rend="italic">Eikon basilike, The pourtraicture of His Sacred Majestie in his solitudes and sufferings</title> (1648; really 1649) refers to “the many-headed Hydra of Government” as a “monstrosity” (p. 71; see "The Many-Headed Hydra" in Curations for this poem).

                        <rdg wit="#ae">From Radiant <seg>Delias<note type="critical">The island of Delos was the supposed birthplace of the god Apollo, and one of the two centres where his cult was established in ancient Greece. Apollo was associated with many things including prophecy, poetry, and the sun. As the elemental edition notes, Delia, the feminized form of the word, may be a transcription error for Delius, but at several other places in her poetry Pulter uses Delia to refer to the Sun god: for example, see <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="1">The Eclipse</ref>, l. 26, <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="12">The Garden, or the Contention of Flowers</ref>, l. 127, and <ref type="pp-poem-ref" corresp="100">This Soul, that Bird, and Fish (Emblem 35)</ref> l. 3. The context of the poem makes it clear that this name refers to the amorous Sun god, but the name Delia was sometimes used by other writers as a synonym for Apollo’s sister Cynthia, goddess of the moon. For example, the character Arete in Ben Jonson’s play <title rend="italic">Cynthia’s Revels</title>, act 5, scene 8, line 18, addresses Cynthia as “celestiall Delia” (<title rend="italic">Ben Jonson, Vol. 4: Cynthia’s Revels; Poetaster; Sejanus; Eastward Ho</title>, edited by C.H. Herford and Percy Simpson, Oxford University Press, 1932, p. 168, Oxford Scholarly Editions Online).</note></seg> frantick fits of loue</rdg>

The implication is that at night, emotions and pain insidiously enter her when her guard is down. Her image of her “trembling brest” (l. 39) evokes vulnerability but the next line suggests some choice: she would rather be strangled than endure this kind of rest. The violence of strangling picks up other brutal actions in the poem, such as the “lashing” carried out by both the Sun and Night’s children (ll. 24 and 34).</note></seg></rdg>
